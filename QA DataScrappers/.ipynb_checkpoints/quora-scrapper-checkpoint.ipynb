Luckily, Airbnb [ https://www.airbnb.com/ ] has plenty of pet-friendly units. Although I had one horrible stay in an Airbnb rented beach house, chock full of black mold, I have since done my due diligence to hopefully ensure that I will never repeat a nightmarish trip like that.\\n\\nI searched Airbnb for an unshared one bedroom, pet-friendly apartment with an Airbnb verified super host with plenty of five-star ratings.\\n\\nAnd Bingo! Just like that, I found a unit [ https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/27959913?source_impression_id=p3_1571465339_ozEe6FJ3tRTKiyzK ] that checked all of my boxes at a reasonable price.\\n\\nThe apartment is at The Park Apartments in Irvine [ https://www.irvinecompanyapartments.com/locations/orange-county/irvine/spectrum/the-park.html ], a luxurious planned community, complete with saltwater pools, Starbucks, gyms, a safe gated community, a shopping mall, and a community dog park, just steps from the apartment.\\n\\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\\n\\nFast-forward a few weeks, and it\\u2019s check-in time.\\n\\nI get in touch with the host, who messages me that he will be in his white BMW, blinkers on, next to the dog park. Once we locate him, we are to follow him into the parking garage and then up to the apartment.\\n\\nI\\u2019m surprised when I don\\u2019t see our host Allen [ https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/201894484 ], but he is busy and has sent his friend to help us out.\\n\\nMy husband parks and takes the dogs across the street to the dog park after the long drive. I follow Allen\\u2019s friend, who instructs me on using the electronic key fob to get through the security gates and who then escorts me to the apartment.\\n\\nWhen we arrive at the door, I\\u2019m confused, as the address does not match the one given to me by Airbnb upon paying for my reservation. I ask why the apartment number differs from the one I received from Airbnb, and he tells me it is for guest safety.\\n\\nSomething about what he says isn\\u2019t making complete sense, but I\\u2019m exhausted from the long drive, and he is from Iran, so English is not his first language. I figure something must have gotten lost in translation and let it pass, as I\\u2019d hate to be rude.\\n\\nHe shows me around the spacious, tastefully decorated apartment. Everything seems in order. His phone is constantly beeping and ringing with texts and calls. He explains that he is in a rush to check in several other guests, and on his way out the door, tells me that the locals are picky, so if anyone asks where I live, when using the gym, pools, or dog park, to say that I\\u2019m visiting my cousin.\\n\\nI have no time to react to what he\\u2019s just said as he shuts the door. I\\u2019m starting to get a bad feeling, but I want to get things settled before my husband returns with the dogs.\\n\\nMoments later, I quickly realize that I let Allen\\u2019s friend go too soon, as I find several issues with the unit, including missing amenities, cleaning issues, and safety concerns. To top it off, the bedroom and its walk-in closet have no working electricity.\\n\\nI shoot him a text and try to troubleshoot the lighting issue. He replies that he\\u2019ll return within the hour.\\n\\nBy the time he reappears, I\\u2019ve written a long list of problems and figured out that a fuse blew in the bedroom, as the bedside lamps work when plugged in elsewhere in the unit.\\n\\nAs we search to find the fuse box, I tell him there is no soap of any type in the entire apartment. He explains that Airbnb advised their hosts to remove all soap from their units due to a lawsuit involving a woman who went bald after washing her hair with a cleaning solution. He asks me if I have seen the news story.\\n\\nFunny \\u2013 I guess I missed that one.\\n\\nI discuss multiple problems and point out two light fixtures requiring multiple bulbs, in the bath and kitchen that have live sockets when turned on, due to missing lightbulbs. I surmise that the fuse blew when a guest, wanting light in the bedroom, replaced a dead lightbulb in the bedside lamp with a bulb taken from one of these other fixtures that had bulbs with wattage ratings that were too high.\\n\\nHe discusses the electrical problems with Allen by phone. He finally hangs up and tells me maintenance will be arriving soon, and I must hide my dogs and their toys before they show up.\\n\\nWhat? This apartment is supposed to be pet-friendly!\\n\\nAs the list of red flags grows, it begins to sink in that this is not a good situation. My husband, who has only been back with the dogs for a half-hour, shoots me a death stare.\\n\\nMy anxiety is swiftly rising, and my livid husband disappears again into the night with our now banished dogs. Just before I blow a fuse of my own, Allen\\u2019s friend finally locates the fuse panel behind the door of the dark bedroom.\\n\\nAfter a few clicks to reset the fuses, the lights finally turn on. Allen\\u2019s friend cancels maintenance, and I text my husband that he can bring the dogs back. He shows me a picture of his dog in an attempt to forge a connection with me in any way he can. This guy is slick. I doubt he even owns a dog.\\n\\nI tell him that my husband is beyond furious, and that I expect a partial refund for the 3 hours of problems we\\u2019ve endured.\\n\\nHe promises to bring me soap and other supplies the next day and will ask Allen about the refund. He makes me promise to leave a positive review if I get any money back. He then leans in for an awkward, unwanted hug and tells me that he is only twenty, and to have a heart.\\n\\nSure. Whatever. Just get out. Get back into your fancy new BMW in all of your overpriced clothing and go back to your \\u2018How to Swindle People Any Way You Can\\u2019 class that you cut, to show me into Allen\\u2019s illegal unit.\\n\\nThese people are making loads of money and not in a way that strikes me as legal.\\n\\nI\\u2019m not surprised when I hear nothing back, no supplies are delivered as promised, and I receive no partial refund over the weekend.\\n\\nBut we\\u2019ve got a wedding to attend, and I don\\u2019t feel safe complaining about disreputable people while staying under their roof. And where else could we go at this late hour with two dogs? As unhappy as we are at this place, we are stuck.\\n\\nLuckily, we have a great time at the wedding, and before we know it, it\\u2019s time to head home. Checkout time is at noon.\\n\\nBefore leaving, I call Spectrum\\u2019s leasing office [ https://www.irvinecompanyapartments.com/locations/orange-county/irvine/spectrum/village-at-irvine-spectrum.html ]. The woman on the line affirms my suspicions that there is something sketchy going on. Residents may only rent one unit, and subletting apartments through Airbnb is strictly prohibited. I give her the address provided by Airbnb, as well as the address where I\\u2019ve been staying.\\n\\nBefore leaving, I do my usual \\u2018end of vacation sweep,\\u2019 checking all drawers, closets, and underneath the furniture to make sure we leave nothing behind. During my sweep, I happen to find a bill for renter\\u2019s insurance. The address matches the apartment that I\\u2019m in, but the name on the invoice is not Allen\\u2019s [ https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/201894484 ]. The letterhead on the invoice is that of a place called Irvine Company [ https://www.irvinecompany.com/ ].\\n\\nI take photos of the bill, the light sockets with missing bulbs (that could kill anyone who doesn\\u2019t know better than to touch them), and of the apartment before leaving.\\n\\nOnce on the road, I had hoped to be able to relax again finally. Unfortunately, now that I feel safe, my ability to think logically and rationally slowly starts to return, but only for a few moments. As I come to grips with how dangerous that situation was, I am a soon a nervous mess all over again.\\n\\nWhat if I had shown up alone? I gave our itinerary to friends and family, with the address of where we were staying, but if anything had happened, no one would have known where we ended up!\\n\\nAny unknown person could have taken me into a unit number that was different than the one given out by Airbnb.\\n\\nThen it hits me: This is precisely what happened.\\n\\nLuckily, my husband was with me, and I didn\\u2019t end up a grim statistic of someone who was drugged, raped, killed, or put into a shipping container and sold into a sex trafficking ring.\\n\\nAs the miles go by, I understand more and more that we unwittingly stayed in a dangerous situation, that blatantly disregarded rules of both Spectrum Apartments and Airbnb.\\n\\nI draft a note to \\u201cAllen\\u201d and forward it through Airbnb\\u2019s resolution program, asking for a complete refund.\\n\\nBut my mind still won\\u2019t rest. There\\u2019s something more to this situation that doesn\\u2019t feel right.\\n\\nI\\u2019m no longer worried about myself. My husband and I are okay. But, I can\\u2019t stop thinking about the safety of others, and what might happen to them if I don\\u2019t get to the bottom of this and set this situation straight to the best of my ability. And these unsafe situations are beginning to feel a lot like the nightmares that Uber and Lyft have been dealing with, but worse.\\n\\nI look up Irvine on Airbnb again. I find countless of verified, super hosts on Airbnb doing the same exact thing as Allen [ https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/201894484 ], who has 9 listings (all through Irvine Company Apartment Communities [ https://www.irvinecompanyapartments.com/ ]) at both the Irvine Spectrum and the Newport Fashion Valley locations, as of October 19, 2019. But the others are easy to track down. Like \\u5927\\u725b [ https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/104168101 ] Amanda [ https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/61729813 ] or Xander. [ https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/89994736 ]\\n\\nI followed the chain of Airbnb super hosts who all list multiple, similar units. Although the addresses are missing, the photos, descriptions of amenities and reviews confirm their locations to be at one or more of the125+ communities managed by Irvine Company Apartment Communities [ https://www.irvinecompanyapartments.com/ ], all up and down the coast of California. Many reviews mention sketchy check-in procedures and guests feeling as if they were in a place they shouldn\\u2019t be.\\n\\nIt doesn\\u2019t take a genius to connect the dots and figure out that Irvine Company Apartment Communities [ https://www.irvinecompanyapartments.com/ ] is owned by Irvine Company, [ https://www.irvinecompany.com/ ] which is owned by one man: Donald Bren. [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Bren ]\\n\\n\\u201cDonald Leroy Bren [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Bren ] (born May 11, 1932) is an American [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States ] businessman who is chairman and sole owner of the Irvine Company [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irvine_Company ], a US real estate investment [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_investment ] company.[8] [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Bren#cite_note-8 ] Bren\\u2019s net worth is approximately $16.3 billion, making him number 30 on the 2018 Forbes 400 list.\\u201d (Taken from Wikipedia)\\n\\nAfter arriving home, I make a few calls and dig a bit deeper. It turns out that Irvine Company Apartment Communities [ https://www.irvinecompanyapartments.com/ ] would like people to think that they are trying to put a stop to this massive, unsafe scam, but what are they doing to stop it? As far as I could tell, nothing.\\n\\nJust imagine signing an expensive lease to live in luxury within a secure, gated community. Then imagine seeing maid carts go from room to room each day in the hallways, new neighbors moving in and out each day in the elevators with their suitcases, crowded dog parks, gyms, and pools full of tourists who are in vacation mode 24-7. And then think about the safety issues of never knowing who your neighbors are, as you get new ones each day.\\n\\nIf I were a legitimate Spectrum [ https://www.irvinecompanyapartments.com/search-results.html?beds=1&submarket=Irvine ] resident, I\\u2019d be furious, and I\\u2019d want out of my lease as quickly as possible. Consider parents who pay extra for safe, gated communities, so they don\\u2019t have to worry while their children are attending UC Irvine [ https://uci.edu/ ] or other California colleges or universities. The safety issues are enough to turn any parent\\u2019s stomach.\\n\\nThe manager who I spoke to at Irvine Company Apartment Communities [ https://www.irvinecompanyapartments.com/ ] sounded as if he was reading from a script when I asked him what he was doing to put a stop to this. Was he working with Airbnb to stop this? Were insiders renting the Airbnb units themselves to determine which apartments are involved?\\n\\nHis answer? \\u201cWell, those would be logical ways to figure things out now, wouldn\\u2019t they?\\u201d He chuckled and then admitted that they have never tried any of these methods.\\n\\nI also asked if the neighbors had been made aware of these ongoing safety issues through a mailing or any other method? Nope. Wouldn\\u2019t want to scare the residents, right?\\n\\nI\\u2019m guessing that as long as the occupancy rates remain as high as possible, with cash flowing in, that managers are happy to look the other way, and this won\\u2019t be stopping anytime soon.\\n\\nAnd what about Airbnb?\\n\\nI ask for the \\u201cVerified\\u201d identification and address of my \\u201cSuper host,\\u201d and they won\\u2019t give it to me. Can\\u2019t give it to me. That would break their privacy rules.\\n\\nAirbnb also knows that Irvine Company Apartment Communities [ https://www.irvinecompanyapartments.com/ ] does not allow Airbnb rentals and that hosts are giving false addresses to get around the rules, but as far as I know, have done nothing to stop it.\\n\\nEven people who are safety conscious could quickly be taken, hurt, or killed, but neither company seems to be taking actions to stop any of this. It would create bad press.\\n\\nI asked Airbnb what people should do, and they told me if I feel unsafe to call the police. I call Spectrum back, and they told me the same thing.\\n\\nBut, I\\u2019m worried about others who this is happening to as well as the legitimate residents who are paying astronomical rents to live in safe, secure, gated communities that aren\\u2019t safe. What about them? And what about developments in other states that might be doing the very same thing? How can anyone ensure their safety at Airbnb or where they operate?\\n\\nThe whole thing leaves me feeling sick.\\n\\nAnd, no. I still have not been refunded for my hellish apartment stay in paradise.\\n\\n~LHK\\n\\nNote: it seems that the word has gotten out. My host has dropped from 12 to 7 listings, and others are changing the wording or language that their listings are posted in, on their Airbnb sites. This will make it harder to spot these scammers, so use extra care when booking.\\n\\nI also learned that the City of Irvine does not allow Airbnb day-to-day subletting! Why Airbnb does not remove all listings in the city of Irvine is a mystery.\\n\\nPosted simultaneously at: Airbnb Luxury Apartment Rentals in California [ https://mosaiccommons.me/2019/10/19/airbnb-luxury-aparment-rentals-in-california/ ]\\n\\nEdit -this came out days after mine: I Accidentally Uncovered a Nationwide Scam on Airbnb \\u2014 VICE [ https://apple.news/Al429uDHfRpqd75hSff7TmQ ]\", \"upvoteCount\": 208, \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-bad-experiences-from-Airbnb-guests-hosts?top_ans=175328510\"}, {\"@type\": \"Answer\", \"author\": {\"@type\": \"Person\", \"answerCount\": 1110, \"description\": \"lives in Cochise County, Arizona\", \"followerCount\": 8918, \"homeLocation\": {\"@type\": \"Place\", \"name\": \"Cochise County, Arizona\"}, \"image\": \"https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-164045589-100-zkihrcmvfhiqzxsloyusywlvgooiqalg.jpeg\", \"name\": \"Emily Fisher\", \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/profile/Emily-Fisher-32\"}, \"text\": \"When my sister and niece left after dropping me off at the Airbnb and getting a tour of her lovely home, my host showed me my room, gave me the keys and basic instructions, along with an inappropriate-feeling rash of how terrible family is, and that she\\u2019d stopped speaking to all of hers decades ago.\\n\\nExcept her daughter, who was off at her first year of college. The Airbnb hosting was a way to help pay for college.\\n\\nAll this information was given to me at surprisingly loud decibels, with her face uncomfortably close to mine.\\n\\nHmm, I thought, after she\\u2019d finally left my room and I began to unpack \\u2014 hopefully she\\u2019s just a rambunctious greeter and will calm down.\\n\\nMeanwhile, if that\\u2019s as bad as it gets, I suppose I can put up with that at this price, in this convenient location, with full use of the living room, kitchen and back patio in the pretty gardens.\\n\\nBut that was by no means as bad as it got.

I had to provide my own.\\n\\nShe yelled at me about having trouble making her house keys work (though she\\u2019d warned me when she handed them over that they didn\\u2019t).\\n\\nShe yelled at me for daring to suggest turning on the air conditioner, though she was keeping the house at 83 degrees (28.3 C). She kept insisting her house had never been too hot for any other guests!\\n\\nI thought better of pointing out that it had just turned hot for the first time of the year around the time I got there, and that this was her first summer hosting.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s no point arguing with that sort of aggression. I just dodged as best I could, reminding myself it wouldn\\u2019t be much longer.\\n\\nBut most of all she yelled about the fan. I sleep better with a fan in my room, for the sound as much as the air, and had borrowed one from my sister to bring over there, asking, of course, if it was alright to use it, before I brought it inside.\\n\\nShe assured me it was no problem at all.\\n\\nI had thought I had brought the fan simply for white noise while I slept, but with the house kept at 83 degrees, frankly, I was awfully glad for the air, too.\\n\\nBut increasingly, she complained about the fan, as the weather got hotter and she passive-aggressively decreased the amount of time she turned on the AC.\\n\\nOne afternoon I intentionally left my fan on when I went out to lunch, knowing I\\u2019d be back within an hour or two, and with the room so stifling...\\n\\nWhen I returned, my room was, yes, stifling, and I saw that she\\u2019d let herself in with her key while I was gone, and yanked the fan cord out of the wall while it was running, though the off switch was plenty large and visible.\\n\\nNo words necessary that time, apparently.\\n\\nThen she told me her daughter was coming home from college a few days before I was due to leave, and would be sleeping with her, emphasis on the silent Since you\\u2019ll be sleeping in her room!\\n\\n*Sigh* I wasn\\u2019t about to start with her at this stage of the game - only had a few more days.\\n\\nShe\\u2019d continually broken the contract while I\\u2019d been there, by not providing a working key, or proper air conditioning, not allowing me use of the house \\u2014 in fact, increasingly, I never left my room if she was home \\u2014 and now she was telling me SURPRISE!, for the last half of my stay I\\u2019d be sharing the bathroom between our two bedrooms not only with her, but with her teenage daughter.\\n\\nOn what unexpectedly turned out to be my last day, I was trying to nap in my room as I\\u2019d been too hot to sleep much the night before.\\n\\nI was just nodding off when awoken by door slamming and stomping around. Since it kept going on, plenty loud over my fan on high, I assumed her daughter must have come home and they were doing who knows what, though I\\u2019d thought the daughter wasn\\u2019t due til the following day.\\n\\nWhen the stomping and slamming went on for three or four hours and I didn\\u2019t hear any voices, eventually I realized, Oh, this must be a revving up of her aggression; yikes, I\\u2019m not coming out of my room for anything!\\n\\nAnd I didn\\u2019t, till late at night when I was sure she must be asleep, though I\\u2019d had to pee for hours.\\n\\nThen in the middle of the night as I was nodding off myself, suddenly she was pounding on my door and yelling, \\u201cNO! NO! NO!\\u201d\\n\\nI opened the door, a bit bug-eyed, and there was her face in my face, shrieking, \\u201cYOU CANNOT RUN THAT FAN 24/7!\\u201d She complained about the cost of the fan, cost of the air conditioner.\\n\\n\\u201cMay I run it through the night?\\u201d I peeped, while wondering how to calm the beast for another 2-3 days, not long.\\n\\n\\u201cYOU MAY RUN IT 10 HOURS A DAY!\\u201d she bellowed.\\n\\n\\u201cOkay,\\u201d I whispered. \\u201cBut, you know, it is increasingly hot in here now that summer\\u2019s kicked in \\u2014 I\\u2019d be glad to chip in for use of the fan if that will help.\\u201d\\n\\nThat\\u2019s when she really lost it, kept screaming, \\u201cNO! NO! NO! YOU WILL BE OUT OF HERE TOMORROW!!! I WILL NOT BE HELD HOSTAGE IN MY OWN HOME!\\u201d\\n\\nAnd here I\\u2019d thought it was all a matter of me taking a thousand deep breaths a day and only putting up with it a while longer.\\n\\nNeedless to say, after that fun night, she pounded on my door early in the morning and yelled, \\u201cTIME TO START PACKING!\\u201d.\\n\\nAnd pack, I did, and got out, without much doubt that consciously or not, she was kicking me out so she\\u2019d have the house for just her and her daughter (as though that couldn\\u2019t have all been avoided with proper scheduling).\\n\\nThis was my first time ever using Airbnb.

I am currently still in dispute with one guest, and seriously considering dropping out of the AirBnb game.\\n\\nThings started off well enough. My first set of of guests were really nice. They accidently broke a vase, but were most apologetic, and offered to pay immediately. ( I declined, but they left a nice bottle of wine as \\u2018payment\\u2019 anyway.) They also left a great review.\\n\\nUnfortunately this lulled me into something of a false sense of security, and I thought that all guests would be of a similar ilk. Boy was I wrong. A few weeks later Pepe and his posse from Spain landed.\\n\\nHe was booked to stay for 2 nights - Aug 15/16\\n\\nHe and his 3 friends arrived on the morning of the 15th at 08.00 am without prior warning of such an early arrival time.\\n\\nI explained that they couldn't check in immediately as we had guests already who would be leaving around 11, and asked that they return at 12.00 midday.\\n\\nThe other guests actually checked out a bit early so we immediately began prepping/cleaning the house and rooms. A short time later we heard the sounds of 'singing' and guitar playing coming from downstairs. Pepe and friends had decided to come back early, let themselves in and treat us to an impromptu performance.\\n\\nI felt a little uneasy about things at this point, but since I was new to the whole AirBnB hosting thing, I welcomed them in anyway, & showed them round the house. With the benefit of hindsight I wish I had trusted my instinct, and shown them the way out.\\n\\nI live in a separate/self contained downstairs part of the house, which is probably just as well- hate to think of what may have happened if I had just left them to it.\\n\\nAlmost immediately there was lots of banging/shouting/arguing and more guitar playing (mine) and 'singing'. Then Pepe knocked at my door wanting use the phone. His mobile he said was broken.\\n\\nHe disappeared with it, and after 20 mins or so, it was so rowdy upstairs that my 7 year old son was becoming visibly upset, so I went up to see what was going on, and to retrieve my phone.\\n\\nThey were obviously in high spirits, & drinking spirits of the strong, distilled variety.They were also smoking. I asked them to calm things a bit, and confine the smoking to the terrace (as is clearly stated in my listing.)\\n\\nThings quietened down for a short while, but then the arguing/shouting/banging/crashing kicked off again, and once more I went up to investigate. I entered the main bedroom to find a red faced very irate Pepe stomping back and forth, hurling abuse at his girlfriend who it seemed had taken refuge beneath the duvet and was trying to ignore him and sleep. I know nothing of their relationship, and I don't understand much Spanish, but my presence seemingly did nothing to stem the flow of verbal abuse in her direction, and I began to become concerned for her safety also.\\n\\nAfter a few minutes Pepe decided to give it up and announced that he needed music and sleep. Apparently these needs would be best served in his car, and so off he went.\\n\\nPeace again. But only for a short time. Shortly after lunch he reappeared, and within a few minutes the slanging match (heated arguing) recommenced.\\n\\nThe shouting increased in intensity and then followed several loud crashes and the sound of something breaking.\\n\\nI ran upstairs to find the bed split in half, and the girl crying.\\n\\nAt this point I asked them to leave, then ran downstairs to take my son across to a neighbours house to ensure that he was out of harms way should the situation deteriorate further.\\n\\nWhen I returned a few minutes later his friends were already packed and making their way out, but Pepe refused to leave until he was refunded in full. I explained that this had to done through the AirBNB channels and that obviously there was damage to my property which had to be paid for. (At that moment I was only aware of the damage to the bed but subsequently found that there was also damage to other furniture and my glass framed photography).\\n\\nThe argument between us became heated, and it became obvious that he wasn't going to leave except under duress, and so I decided to call the Police. (I also sent AirBnB a message alerting them to the situation via the AirBnB mobile app to which I received no response to date but we will come back to that..)\\n\\n90 min later or so the Police finally arrived...\\n\\nThe transformation in Pepe's character was remarkable. He became quietly spoken, polite, and deferential.\\n\\nApparently much of what happened was my fault and he had only wanted a quiet rest. I hadn't heard any banging or arguing, that must have been the neighbours. The broken bed, he was insistent, simply broke while he sleeping on it.\\n\\nHe wasn't even having sex or anything like that and he performed a little mime of the action (both the sleeping and copulation lest we be in any doubt.)\\n\\nThe French police - there were 3 of them but only apparently one with a functioning brain- were impressed (actually so was I ), and seemed to be agreeing with him that it was probably because the bed was old ( I bought it new 3 years ago) and already weakened from all the previous copulatory activity that had occurred thereon. (I wish).\\n\\nAfter much discussion they reluctantly agreed that Pepe should leave, but first I had to reimburse him for his non-stay.\\n\\nAt this point I had given up all hope of extracting damages for the bed, but was just desperate to get the guy, and Le Law out of my house. I explained to them that the only way I could reimburse him was through the AirBNb website, and that this was seemingly further complicated by the fact that according to AirBnB he had already 'checked in'. Pepe was insistent that he wouldn't leave until he had seen proof of cancellation. I told him to simply cancel it himself via his mobile phone, but of course as we already know that was broken..so I let him onto my computer and he logged onto AirBnb and cancelled, but then he couldn't access his hotmail account -to see the email proof of cancellation, confirmation, because hotmail was sending him a SMS log-in code which of course he couldn't receive on his non-functional mobile..\\n\\nEventually the Police woman with the brain suggested that he borrow his friends mobile, and switch sim cards.\\n\\nThis finally worked and finally Pepe was able to see his proof of cancellation.\\n\\nThere were tears and hugs as everybody said their final goodbyes. Actually I made the first and last part of that sentence up.\\n\\nFinally I showed them all the door, and Pepe walked off into the sunset, at which point I realised he still had the house keys and so had to go running after him. He couldn't find them on his person or in his bags, so I (very) reluctantly had to bring him back to the house to search for them.. By this time I was beginning to feel as though I was in a Tarantino movie and this was the epilogue.\\n\\nFinally he located the key, and with a level stare handed it to me.\\n\\n'You know I'm an expert in Karate'\\n\\n\\\"I know\\\", I said. \\\"I've seen my bed.\\\"\\n\\nAll joking aside. I think I got off fairly lightly.\\n\\nA broken bed.\\n\\nA broken Arabic rocking chair from my time in Dubai, of sentimental rather than great monetary value.\\n\\nA broken picture frame.\\n\\nNobody hurt, physically at least.\\n\\nBut it sure gave me reservations about my reservations policy. I stopped taking Instant Bookings and always vet people much more thoroughly via a few emails before accepting a booking now. Even this isnt a fail safe guarantee (Pepe was a host with apparently good references,which I took note of in accepting his reservation).\\n\\nIn the end AirBnb didn\\u2019t do much - other than advise me to increase the amount of my security for damages deposit. And they said they had barred Pepe although I nver verified if this was indeed the case.\\n\\nSince then I haven\\u2019t had anything quite as dramatic, but still a fair few incidents which I will maybe write about another time (The one where the \\u2018nice\\u2019 family kids painted the bedsheets with oil based non-washable paints comes to mind..) Currently as a I said at the start of this piece I am embroiled in a dispute with my last guest who took my brand new torch from the side of the fridge camping with them then \\u2018forgot\\u2019 to return, and are now saying they aren\\u2019t going to because they had been awoken by \\u2018noise\\u2019 too many times during their stay -something they had neglected to mention or complain about during the several times I enquired how the stay was going when I saw them.

With eight people to accommodate, hotels were certainly out of our budget so we naturally turned to Airbnb to search for an affordable three-bedroom condo.\\n\\nEveryone arrived fairly late that evening, exhausted but safe and sound, and in a hurry as the plane had landed with some delay after a lengthy journey from France including a seven-hour layover in Dubai. It was past 11 pm and we managed to hop onto the last train bound to our destination (still having to change trains twice though), as shuttle bus service from/to the airport was already over at that hour.\\n\\nWe eventually made it to our destination at around midnight, everyone longing for a good night of sleep to kick off their much anticipated two-week vacations in this faraway land.\\n\\n\\u2026\\n\\nOkay, we\\u2019re in front of the building, now we just have to fetch the keys from this box with a four-digit passcode:\\n\\n(the actual box from that night)\\n\\nLet me check the booking confirmation email\\u2026 okay here\\u2019s the code, now unlocking the box\\u2026\\n\\nDoesn\\u2019t work. Perhaps I\\u2019ve misread the code, got the order reversed, or dialed in a wrong digit as it was already late at night and street lights were quite dim in that neighborhood. Double-checking and trying again\\u2026 in vain.\\n\\n\\u2026\\n\\nThen I tried to give a call to the host to report the issue, and waited, waited, still waited, but nothing. Nobody would pick up the damn phone, yes it was almost 1 am but the very least you can do on a day you\\u2019re expecting guests is to make yourself available, and ensure that your guests arrive at their destination. I would understand if it were like 4 am in the morning, but having your guests board the last train and arrive at destination late at night is still a plausible scenario, and if in doubt, they could have called me directly as I was in Tokyo the whole time (I booked that place under my name and gave my contact details).\\n\\nI might have tried to call at least a couple dozen times on that night.\\n\\nAfter another half an hour of trying any means to find any clue on how to get our hands on those damn keys, short of cracking that stupid box open, we eventually gave up and decided to find another roof for that night, at least until dawn when we could hopefully get in touch with the host. My mom was exhausted from the journey, my sister was nervous on the verge of snapping and let\\u2019s not forget all the suitcases we had to carry around, under the scorching summer heat to top it all.\\n\\nWe walked towards the nearest major train station for a good kilometer and tried our chance in the first manga cafe we came across. While no place to have a good rest, we could at least relax in an air-conditioned room with access to fresh drinks, toilets and some entertainment to kill time until the morning.\\n\\n\\u201cEight people, is it? Let me check if there are any booths available\\u2026 err, is that boy underage by any chance?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYes, is there an issue with that?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry but the law forbids us to serve any underage customer after 10 pm.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cReally. Could you turn a blind eye on this for us? We\\u2019re quite desperate here after a long flight and everyone is exhausted.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m deeply sorry.\\u201d\\n\\nYep, my mom\\u2019s boyfriend\\u2019s son, aged 12, was with us. There\\u2019s nothing we could do about this unfortunately, and the Japanese clerks are especially reputed for their diligence so no much could be gained by imposing ourselves on that poor guy. So we decided to hit somewhere else\\u2026 and ended up in a nearby McDonald\\u2019s for the rest of the night.\\n\\n\\u2026\\n\\nCome the morning, I finally got to reach someone over the phone at around 6 am. From the sound of his voice, the guy had obviously just woke up from his peaceful, unsuspecting slumber. I complained about the whole ordeal we just had to go through, and after a few words of apology from the other side, we finally got to learn that the passcode for the lock had been changed recently and it was their fault they didn\\u2019t communicate it to us. Good grief. For the record, I booked that condo two months before the actual trip, so they had plenty of time to do so, but okay, whatever, we\\u2019re all so fucking tired here so let\\u2019s just grab those damn keys for now and hit the sack already.\\n\\nA few days later I got an email from the actual host, or manager; actually the guy I had on the phone was her co-worker and she was currently abroad, and deeply sorry for everything that happened. I was furious in my reply and demanded a full refund for a quarter of the rent, that is for that night we were locked out and the emotional stress we all had to endure. However, after some cooling down I sent another email that evening to reword my request, and just settle for a refund for that night only. She thanked me profusely for that \\u201cchange of heart\\u201d, promised me to comply and begged me not to take this whole issue to Airbnb. Well, in retrospective, I wish I did anyway.\\n\\nAnd that was it, a very eventful first few days, not to mention that my second sister\\u2019s boyfriend got hit by a nasty gastroenteritis merely a couple days later that had him stuck at home for the next five days so many of our plans had to be cancelled, and all the tension that was building up eventually got my first sister to snap in anger and frustration, and my mom to break down in tears one evening, but fortunately everyone quickly reconciled and just blamed it on all the misfortune that fell on us from the beginning. Everyone had tons of fun during the rest of the holidays and that\\u2019s what mattered the most.\\n\\nAs a parting note, while I did not take anything directly to the attention of Airbnb, I did write a lengthy review later and posted it on that room\\u2019s page, only to see its length (roughly the same as this post) trimmed to about a third, which enraged me for all the time that got wasted, but just left it at that in the end. However, I can\\u2019t help but wondering what Airbnb is trying to achieve by allowing such lazy management to happen under their name. Wasn\\u2019t their core business concept about hosts giving a warm welcome to travelers by accommodating them inside their own homes? I hope for them this was an isolated case.\\n\\nAlso, in retrospective I really blame myself for not having thought earlier of taking everyone to my own place that was merely ten kilometers from there, just a hop by taxi. Eight people in a one-bedroom cramped apartment, maybe, but at least everyone could more or less relax, go to the toilet or take a shower, which would have been leagues better than staying for many hours at that McDonald\\u2019s. My thoughts were clouded by everything that happened on that night. Dammit.\\n\\nThanks for reading.

The day after she arrived, I got an email late in the day saying that it was unlivable and terrible conditions (a bunch of lies about broken electronics and lack of cleanliness, which my own pictures and previous reviews will negate). \\n\\n2 weeks later she wrote a review on my listing. A cruel, vindictive review completely meant to destroy my business, filled with lies about things like broken appliances that were working, hair in the bed I had just freshly laundered, a dirty fridge I just bleached. She wrote that she was shocked that I didn't offer her a refund. I informed her that this was because she never cancelled her reservation and thus, if she is there or not, the week is hers and is blocked on my calendar, I cannot accept new bookings, its her reserved time. So why should she be refunded for reserving my time?\\n\\nAfter her terrible review of my listing went live online I was forced to end my business and deactivate my listings, as that review completely killed my chance of securing other guests. Of course, she knew that. \\n\\nThen, this guest called airbnb to demand a refund for the week that they reserved and never cancelled (but decided was uninhabitable so went elsewhere). Airbnb contacted me about this several times in a very cryptic manner, asking for \\\"resolution\\\". I said that it seems resolved to me. My business is now ruined and my listings deactivated, and this person got to write her review, she paid for 7 days and never cancelled, leaving us with an active reservation and thus no ability to make money. How could I help her with problems she never voiced? She never told me about any of this until 2 weeks later. \\nAirbnb was SOOO rude and unhelpful. Their general policy is that hosts and guests should resolve issues on their own. Its even hard to find their phone number. They were condescending, rude, irritable at my legitimate grievance. Despite reserving a whole week of our time, she is being refunded for 6 days (and these are days which I could not do business in)\\n\\nThis is all because she had \\\"pictures\\\" to prove the lack of cleanliness. I said i would also provide any and all documentation, and in the long run, if she wanted a refund, she should have cancelled to free the week, or simply told us her issues and we would have worked to solve them or even offered a partial refund. NO. She was too cruel and too unreasonable AND the airbnb staff took her side, often citing it was because she was a \\\"first time user\\\". First time user? Meaning she doesnt understand the home-stay model, doesnt know how to communicate, and expected a 5 star hotel in the middle of NYC for $89/night. Makes no sense. \\n\\nWhy does she deserve a refund? She reserved a week of my time, whether or not she decided to stay (and didnt give us the chance to help her). she has pictures? I have pictures too. I was never listened to. Airbnb basically told me to stop contacting them and they made up their mind. \\nSo now I have to PAY my guest who RUINED my business hundreds of dollars, as it was decided by the airbnb team. \\n\\nPenalizing hosts who work in the community and follow all the rules is NOT the way to solve a problem. Thats how they just lost 4 lucrative NYC listings. \\n\\nI'll just stick to the charming family-run guest houses of the countries I backpack through for my true home-stay experience. airbnb is a business through and through, and have ZERO LOYALTY TO HOSTS. \\n\\nHosts are money to them. A means to an end. I have never been treated so rudely by staff, nor had my legitimate grievances heard by them. \\n\\nNeedless to say, I will NEVER host with them again of course. And now I feel uncomfortable and betrayed by their company, I wont be using them for travel. They refuse to take any responsibility and typically side with the guests no matter what the problem is. I've been scammed and forced to pay before but at least these scammers stayed for a night and didnt leave me a bad review. this Lisi D came and purposely to ruined my business and then demanded money. And airbnb made me give it to her.\", \"upvoteCount\": 23, \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-bad-experiences-from-Airbnb-guests-hosts?top_ans=14905626\"}, {\"@type\": \"Answer\", \"author\": {\"@type\": \"Person\", \"answerCount\": 1289, \"followerCount\": 786, \"image\": \"https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-122884172-100-bgumhnndkipudkjniwiqkbcwfpxicgya.jpeg\", \"name\": \"Pamela Harvey\", \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/profile/Pamela-Harvey-6\"}, \"text\": \"When my volunteer job at a yoga retreat ended suddenly, I needed a new place to live and work. My retreat job included food and housing (thankfully), but then when the volunteer program went offline for a while, I was ejected and suddenly I found myself at financial rock bottom, with no job and no place to live. Plus no car, and living in a remote area. I will also add that this volunteer yoga job came right after I had suddenly ended an abusive marriage after an incident serious enough to call police, send him to jail for the night, take him to court and press charges.\\n\\nAfter my term at the yoga retreat, I reserved a room at an Airbnb for a few nights as a temporary fix. When I realized how long it would take me to sort out the overwhelming stress in the situation, I needed something more long term. Even my stress had stress.\\n\\nI was able to rent the room on a monthly basis. I had no idea where I would go for the near (or not so near) future, and realized that I couldn\\u2019t realistically make any decisions that I could trust, so the Airbnb thing was ideal for that, giving me some time and a temporary location while I tried to unpack everything that had happened, trying to figure out \\u201cwhat next?\\u201d\\n\\nWhen I first walked into the house, I noticed that she was wearing an oversized tunic with black tights underneath. Her legs were a pair of black twigs emerging from under her oversized sweater, and her meticulously colored auburn hair was perfect. I could see she was one of \\u201cthose\\u201d people - people I warned about in another post on Quora. People who are as obsessed with every aspect of their lives, and who suffer fools poorly, as they are with staying thin beyond attractiveness.\\n\\nHere is what makes this tale one of those \\u201cyou couldn\\u2019t make this up\\u201d stories. I will list the qualities that in my experience were worthy of a \\u201ccouldn\\u2019t make this up\\u201d episode. And you really couldn\\u2019t. Make this up.\\n\\nThis woman, my landlord, was a perfectionist. I am well aware that this tendency is not exactly a newsflash, but this is where a slavish devotion to details went horribly wrong. She had a procedure for storing reusable plastic bags in one specific way, and would frequently demonstrate her required method of plastic bag storage. Also, she would frequently demonstrate her \\u201ccorrect\\u201d method of storing extra brown paper grocery bags, if she deemed my bag storage skills were slipping.\\n\\nShe disallowed my use of the laundry, (which had been originally included in my rent) claiming my \\u201coverly frequent\\u201d use of the washer and dryer caused her utility bill to increase. Hey, I work out daily. That makes a lot of laundry. I don\\u2019t see you running or even walking or lifting one of your pasty white skinny fingers to do anything.\\n\\nIn fact she was so anxious about her utility bill that when I would go out and if I hadn\\u2019t turned off the light in my room, she would run right into my room and turn off the light. I only know this because when, several times I forgot something and came back to get whatever I had forgotten and saw her turning off the lamp. If I wasn\\u2019t going out and I was sitting/working in the house, I watched her run into my room to shut down the light.\\n\\nOne time she mentioned random coffee grounds on her countertops and incomplete cleaning of the silverware. (Yes, I know, she might have a point there because who wants to start any mixing/slicing/juicing at a countertop with someone else\\u2019s crumbs or coffee grounds?) But\\u2026 ever onward.\\n\\nA couple of times in warmer, sunny weather, I used her laundry drying rack (to save money on the laundry fee) outside, where there was a lovely deck, nice and sunny. When the clothes were dry I folded it back up and put it back in the basement.\\n\\nThen later she came up to me saying \\u201cYou didn\\u2019t fold the drying rack correctly. Let\\u2019s go over this again so you will do it the right way next time.\\u201d\\n\\nPretty soon it was clear to me that this was a woman who was skating on such financial thin ice that any even minor increases in household expenses for her caused incredible anxiety and fearful fantasies of being homeless. It\\u2019s also the partial cause of her protective stance about her appliances since she didn\\u2019t think she could afford to repair or replace any.\\n\\nProfessionally, and somewhat ironically, she was a defrocked therapist. She had left her job because of \\u201cdisability\\u201d with a group practice because she couldn\\u2019t deal with people, clients or coworkers. OMG the woman was on 10 meds daily.\\n\\nSo, to continue, when Airbnb guests were staying at her house, she insisted that they come first in everything. This meant I had to make a fresh pot of coffee every morning because she didn\\u2019t want her guests to be served from the pot of coffee I had made when I got up earlier in the am.\\n\\nOnce, at just about the same time as a family of guests was getting ready to leave, I came back from a run and went straight to the shower. No sooner had I started to feel that \\u201churts-so-good\\u201d delicious hot water beating down on my tired body, that I heard her barge into the bathroom and tell me to get out of the shower immediately because one of the guests wanted to use the bathroom before getting into their car. OMFG. Is she fucking KIDDING me??!!!\\n\\nNeedless to say, there were no apologies from either of us.\\n\\nSpeaking of coffee, since there was no garbage disposal I had to dispose of the used grounds in a bag of some sort or just wrapped up in a paper towel, and then take the used grounds to the large trashcan outside. I also later thought to dispose the used grounds in the soil where her plants were starting to grow - might be a good fertilizer.\\n\\nOn one of these coffee runs I spilled some coffee & grounds, leaving a stain on the driveway. With her picky picky perfectionism I seriously had to wonder if I should immediately hose down the driveway. This was just like the coffee grounds and crumbs on the counter, only not. It was outside. So I asked her. And her reply was:\\n\\n\\u201cDo you really think I am that crazy?\\u201d I dodged the question by replying that I really wasn\\u2019t qualified to judge her sanity, thus ending the exchange. So maybe she wasn\\u2019t \\u201cthat\\u201d crazy, but she was certainly well on her way. And dragging me with her.\\n\\nThe worst part about this is that I started to question my judgment as to which \\u201coffenses\\u201d were a problem for her and which ones were not, in kind of a \\u201cgaslighting\\u201d sort of way.\\n\\nShe kept the house at 64\\u02da, insisting that 64\\u02dawas a perfect temp. I reminded her that 68\\u02da, not 64\\u02da, is defined as \\u201croom temperature\\u201d through out most of the civilized world. She just deployed her therapist-speak to say we had \\u201cdifferent ideas\\u201d of what was a normal temp, and can\\u2019t we just get along?\\n\\nAnd of course, in the colder months I used her space heater to keep warm, and to better work my internet job without actually shivering. Space heaters are a well-known drain on anyone\\u2019s utility bill, but she took it a step further and asked me to schedule the space heater 2 hours on, 2 hours off, rationing my use.\\n\\nOne time I had cut my finger and used a bandaid from my toiletries to stop the bleeding. Then, months later, she out-of-the-blue asked me if I was using her bandaids, because her bandaid supply appeared to be diminishing. Wow. Who the flock keeps track of bandaids inventory.\\n\\nAnother stress point: a minor one but still bat-shit crazy: She would occasionally fix chicken for her dinner, and after dinner she couldn\\u2019t throw a chicken carcass down a disposal not only because a garbage disposal cannot handle poultry bones, because there wasn\\u2019t a disposal to begin with. She would put the chicken bones in a plastic bag, put them in the trunk of her car to dispose of later at the community recycling center. She wouldn\\u2019t just right away drive the four blocks to the recycling center because she did not want to spend extra gas on a single errand. The chicken carcass might stay in the trunk for a couple of weeks, depending on when she decided to go to the recycling center.\\n\\nBecause of her social-worker background, when she would make requests of me she would get to her point in an oblique, indirect way, so that I would take the \\u201chint\\u201d and do something or stop doing something as if it was my idea. My first husband and his family were like this. Instead of asking me directly to do something, instead of saying what they wanted in plain English, they would wander around the issue and wait for me to think it up myself.\\n\\nSimilarly, Ms. Airbnb host had a wood stove, which, if stocked with new wood and with regular supervision, would heat the whole house if it was kept going long enough. A couple of times I started the fire, but was then reprimanded for doing it wrong. So I stopped paying any attention to the wood stove, and left that up to her. Then we\\u2019d be sitting there, keeping the fire going, and she\\u2019d say \\u201care you afraid of the wood stove?\\u201d And I would say \\u201cNo\\u201d, and not elaborate, and left it at that. What she really meant, instead of asking me indirectly if I am afraid of the wood stove, was \\u201cwhy don\\u2019t you start the fire sometimes?\\u201d. I am not a mind reader, and if anyone wants to discuss anything with me, speak up!\\n\\nAfter all our discussions about coffee grounds, crumbs, room temperature, etc. she began the following routine: each time I would go into the kitchen, she would come out of her room, not immediately because that would make it obvious that she was checking on me. But that was exactly what she was doing, because she would then shuffle around, pretending to look in the cupboards for for some food item, or check the outside temp, or put some more logs in the fire.\\n\\nIn all fairness, though, we did have a lot in common - fashion design, art, music. And when she wasn\\u2019t obsessing on something I did that she didn\\u2019t like, we actually had a sort-of friendship. She played the mandolin with an informal group of musicians and she invited me to their jam sessions. We went on walks together, went to movies together, with a couple of her friends.\\n\\nDuring this time I needed to be gentle with myself because I was not as mentally and emotionally strong as I am used to being. In the space of the two previous years I had moved three times, so I was recovering from moving stress, bankruptcy stress, domestic abuse stress, job loss stress, all the major players in the stress playbook.\\n\\nThe Airbnb from hell.\", \"upvoteCount\": 1, \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-bad-experiences-from-Airbnb-guests-hosts?top_ans=95532212\"}, {\"@type\": \"Answer\", \"author\": {\"@type\": \"Person\", \"answerCount\": 3, \"followerCount\": 0, \"image\": \"\", \"name\": \"Julie Myers\", \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/profile/Julie-Myers-1\"}, \"text\": \"I had a guest from Italy for 3 months.

She used my address to establish permanent residency in the U.S. and to open financial accounts without telling me. She took a hammer to my quartz countertop, causing $1000 in damage and then said it was gouged by someone else (no one else was in the house). She hung her underwear on my awnings to dry because she did not like the dryer. I came home to find her building wooden displays in my living room and with cans of black spray ready to paint them in my house. She poisoned my dog deliberately and I had to spend $800 at the vet. She took my carved wooden salad spoons from Africa and used them to stir pasta and ruined them. She said that anything I cooked smelled bad and I should eat out. She threw out pieces of silverware, chef's knives, and china. She threatened to write horrible reviews about me on Airbnb if I did not drive her where she wanted to go and help her with her errands. I called Airbnb for help and they were useless. They said it was my problem. The night she finally left she poured red wine all over expensive new white linens. I found out I could not collect the deposit or the Host Guarantee because I \\\"did not have proof\\\" even though I sent 20 pages of documents and photos.

However, after seveal unpleasant experiences, enough was enough! \\n\\nThere was the German woman who was trying out several different neighborhoods with her husband ahead of their relocating to San Francisco. She decided raiding my cabinet and helping herself to my food to make a picnic for a friend she invited into my home without my knowledge was acceptable because she left $5 on the table. Meanwhile, they packed breakable dinnerware and flatware, cloth napkins, and my dinner for a trip to the beach. Fortunately, they left the next morning. Her American husband was at least embarrassed and apologetic.\\n\\nThe Japanese yoga student traveling the world who decided to take my personal yoga mat to use at a class without my permission.\\n\\nThe American-Chinese girl who oiled her feet then left oily footprints on  my newly professinally shampooed wall-to-wall carpeting.\\n\\nBut, the straw that broke the camel's back was the American woman in her 60's from Tennessee. Regularly visits her son who lives in a studio and thrilled to ginally get a reservation with me, she said she's out all day and very neat. Yes, that's great as I work from home and I expected guests to spend their days out sightseeing. Only a brief walk and then, a long bath in the shared bathroom and a long nap. She brought her own cleaning supplies and decided to clean the spotless bathroom walls one day when I was out. Okayyyy. So, it was with great surprise that on the monring she was leaving, she'd made her bed instead of stripping the sheets...until I pulled back the covers to a large red stain on the top sheet that went through the blanket. I realized then I didn't have her number. Wishing it was red wine, I knew it was blood. I'd overheard her tell her son that a wound on her knew wouldn't stop bleeding. \\n\\nAirbnb at that time shared all host's emails with their guest so , of course, she lied about the blood, saying she was unaware of it.

The first one we drove around town 3 times, as the postcode took our sat-nav to a different place to the actual address; we were also looking for a sign on the building as we thought it was a regular B&B, having booked it under that belief.

After a few rounds of emails with questions asked and answered, the mother indicated that her daughter had a 'slight' disability, and sometimes used a wheelchair (folding) but really only when tired. I immediately replied that my listing was most definitely not wheelchair accessible and that the house was not handicap-friendly. Steps to enter the house, staircase to the guest rooms, no handrails in bathrooms, etc. The guest replied that this was no problem at all, the daughter could walk, had no other issues at all, just used the chair when tired.
