0,0,"After receiving an invitation to a friend’s wedding in Irvine, California, I got right to work searching for the perfect place to stay with my husband and our two dogs for our upcoming weekend trip.

Traveling with dogs adds an extra layer of complexity to trip planning, even if they’re well behaved, as many locations don’t want to take a chance. Luckily, Airbnb [ https://www.airbnb.com/ ] has plenty of pet-friendly units. Although I had one horrible stay in an Airbnb rented beach house, chock full of black mold, I have since done my due diligence to hopefully ensure that I will never repeat a nightmarish trip like that.

I searched Airbnb for an unshared one bedroom, pet-friendly apartment with an Airbnb verified super host with plenty of five-star ratings.

And Bingo! Just like that, I found a unit [ https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/27959913?source_impression_id=p3_1571465339_ozEe6FJ3tRTKiyzK ] that checked all of my boxes at a reasonable price.

The apartment is at The Park Apartments in Irvine [ https://www.irvinecompanyapartments.com/locations/orange-county/irvine/spectrum/the-park.html ], a luxurious planned community, complete with saltwater pools, Starbucks, gyms, a safe gated community, a shopping mall, and a community dog park, just steps from the apartment.

What could possibly go wrong?

Fast-forward a few weeks, and it’s check-in time.

I get in touch with the host, who messages me that he will be in his white BMW, blinkers on, next to the dog park. Once we locate him, we are to follow him into the parking garage and then up to the apartment.

I’m surprised when I don’t see our host Allen [ https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/201894484 ], but he is busy and has sent his friend to help us out.

My husband parks and takes the dogs across the street to the dog park after the long drive. I follow Allen’s friend, who instructs me on using the electronic key fob to get through the security gates and who then escorts me to the apartment.

When we arrive at the door, I’m confused, as the address does not match the one given to me by Airbnb upon paying for my reservation. I ask why the apartment number differs from the one I received from Airbnb, and he tells me it is for guest safety.

Something about what he says isn’t making complete sense, but I’m exhausted from the long drive, and he is from Iran, so English is not his first language. I figure something must have gotten lost in translation and let it pass, as I’d hate to be rude.

He shows me around the spacious, tastefully decorated apartment. Everything seems in order. His phone is constantly beeping and ringing with texts and calls. He explains that he is in a rush to check in several other guests, and on his way out the door, tells me that the locals are picky, so if anyone asks where I live, when using the gym, pools, or dog park, to say that I’m visiting my cousin.

I have no time to react to what he’s just said as he shuts the door. I’m starting to get a bad feeling, but I want to get things settled before my husband returns with the dogs.

Moments later, I quickly realize that I let Allen’s friend go too soon, as I find several issues with the unit, including missing amenities, cleaning issues, and safety concerns. To top it off, the bedroom and its walk-in closet have no working electricity.

I shoot him a text and try to troubleshoot the lighting issue. He replies that he’ll return within the hour.

By the time he reappears, I’ve written a long list of problems and figured out that a fuse blew in the bedroom, as the bedside lamps work when plugged in elsewhere in the unit.

As we search to find the fuse box, I tell him there is no soap of any type in the entire apartment. He explains that Airbnb advised their hosts to remove all soap from their units due to a lawsuit involving a woman who went bald after washing her hair with a cleaning solution. He asks me if I have seen the news story.

Funny – I guess I missed that one.

I discuss multiple problems and point out two light fixtures requiring multiple bulbs, in the bath and kitchen that have live sockets when turned on, due to missing lightbulbs. I surmise that the fuse blew when a guest, wanting light in the bedroom, replaced a dead lightbulb in the bedside lamp with a bulb taken from one of these other fixtures that had bulbs with wattage ratings that were too high.

He discusses the electrical problems with Allen by phone. He finally hangs up and tells me maintenance will be arriving soon, and I must hide my dogs and their toys before they show up.

What? This apartment is supposed to be pet-friendly!

As the list of red flags grows, it begins to sink in that this is not a good situation. My husband, who has only been back with the dogs for a half-hour, shoots me a death stare.

My anxiety is swiftly rising, and my livid husband disappears again into the night with our now banished dogs. Just before I blow a fuse of my own, Allen’s friend finally locates the fuse panel behind the door of the dark bedroom.

After a few clicks to reset the fuses, the lights finally turn on. Allen’s friend cancels maintenance, and I text my husband that he can bring the dogs back. He shows me a picture of his dog in an attempt to forge a connection with me in any way he can. This guy is slick. I doubt he even owns a dog.

I tell him that my husband is beyond furious, and that I expect a partial refund for the 3 hours of problems we’ve endured.

He promises to bring me soap and other supplies the next day and will ask Allen about the refund. He makes me promise to leave a positive review if I get any money back. He then leans in for an awkward, unwanted hug and tells me that he is only twenty, and to have a heart.

Sure. Whatever. Just get out. Get back into your fancy new BMW in all of your overpriced clothing and go back to your ‘How to Swindle People Any Way You Can’ class that you cut, to show me into Allen’s illegal unit.

These people are making loads of money and not in a way that strikes me as legal.

I’m not surprised when I hear nothing back, no supplies are delivered as promised, and I receive no partial refund over the weekend.

But we’ve got a wedding to attend, and I don’t feel safe complaining about disreputable people while staying under their roof. And where else could we go at this late hour with two dogs? As unhappy as we are at this place, we are stuck.

Luckily, we have a great time at the wedding, and before we know it, it’s time to head home. Checkout time is at noon.

Before leaving, I call Spectrum’s leasing office [ https://www.irvinecompanyapartments.com/locations/orange-county/irvine/spectrum/village-at-irvine-spectrum.html ]. The woman on the line affirms my suspicions that there is something sketchy going on. Residents may only rent one unit, and subletting apartments through Airbnb is strictly prohibited. I give her the address provided by Airbnb, as well as the address where I’ve been staying.

Before leaving, I do my usual ‘end of vacation sweep,’ checking all drawers, closets, and underneath the furniture to make sure we leave nothing behind. During my sweep, I happen to find a bill for renter’s insurance. The address matches the apartment that I’m in, but the name on the invoice is not Allen’s [ https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/201894484 ]. The letterhead on the invoice is that of a place called Irvine Company [ https://www.irvinecompany.com/ ].

I take photos of the bill, the light sockets with missing bulbs (that could kill anyone who doesn’t know better than to touch them), and of the apartment before leaving.

Once on the road, I had hoped to be able to relax again finally. Unfortunately, now that I feel safe, my ability to think logically and rationally slowly starts to return, but only for a few moments. As I come to grips with how dangerous that situation was, I am a soon a nervous mess all over again.

What if I had shown up alone? I gave our itinerary to friends and family, with the address of where we were staying, but if anything had happened, no one would have known where we ended up!

Any unknown person could have taken me into a unit number that was different than the one given out by Airbnb.

Then it hits me: This is precisely what happened.

Luckily, my husband was with me, and I didn’t end up a grim statistic of someone who was drugged, raped, killed, or put into a shipping container and sold into a sex trafficking ring.

As the miles go by, I understand more and more that we unwittingly stayed in a dangerous situation, that blatantly disregarded rules of both Spectrum Apartments and Airbnb.

I draft a note to “Allen” and forward it through Airbnb’s resolution program, asking for a complete refund.

But my mind still won’t rest. There’s something more to this situation that doesn’t feel right.

I’m no longer worried about myself. My husband and I are okay. But, I can’t stop thinking about the safety of others, and what might happen to them if I don’t get to the bottom of this and set this situation straight to the best of my ability. And these unsafe situations are beginning to feel a lot like the nightmares that Uber and Lyft have been dealing with, but worse.

I look up Irvine on Airbnb again. I find countless of verified, super hosts on Airbnb doing the same exact thing as Allen [ https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/201894484 ], who has 9 listings (all through Irvine Company Apartment Communities [ https://www.irvinecompanyapartments.com/ ]) at both the Irvine Spectrum and the Newport Fashion Valley locations, as of October 19, 2019. But the others are easy to track down. Like 大牛 [ https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/104168101 ] Amanda [ https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/61729813 ] or Xander. [ https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/89994736 ]

I followed the chain of Airbnb super hosts who all list multiple, similar units. Although the addresses are missing, the photos, descriptions of amenities and reviews confirm their locations to be at one or more of the125+ communities managed by Irvine Company Apartment Communities [ https://www.irvinecompanyapartments.com/ ], all up and down the coast of California. Many reviews mention sketchy check-in procedures and guests feeling as if they were in a place they shouldn’t be.

It doesn’t take a genius to connect the dots and figure out that Irvine Company Apartment Communities [ https://www.irvinecompanyapartments.com/ ] is owned by Irvine Company, [ https://www.irvinecompany.com/ ] which is owned by one man: Donald Bren. [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Bren ]

“Donald Leroy Bren [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Bren ] (born May 11, 1932) is an American [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States ] businessman who is chairman and sole owner of the Irvine Company [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irvine_Company ], a US real estate investment [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_investment ] company.[8] [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Bren#cite_note-8 ] Bren’s net worth is approximately $16.3 billion, making him number 30 on the 2018 Forbes 400 list.” (Taken from Wikipedia)

After arriving home, I make a few calls and dig a bit deeper. It turns out that Irvine Company Apartment Communities [ https://www.irvinecompanyapartments.com/ ] would like people to think that they are trying to put a stop to this massive, unsafe scam, but what are they doing to stop it? As far as I could tell, nothing.

Just imagine signing an expensive lease to live in luxury within a secure, gated community. Then imagine seeing maid carts go from room to room each day in the hallways, new neighbors moving in and out each day in the elevators with their suitcases, crowded dog parks, gyms, and pools full of tourists who are in vacation mode 24-7. And then think about the safety issues of never knowing who your neighbors are, as you get new ones each day.

If I were a legitimate Spectrum [ https://www.irvinecompanyapartments.com/search-results.html?beds=1&submarket=Irvine ] resident, I’d be furious, and I’d want out of my lease as quickly as possible. Consider parents who pay extra for safe, gated communities, so they don’t have to worry while their children are attending UC Irvine [ https://uci.edu/ ] or other California colleges or universities. The safety issues are enough to turn any parent’s stomach.

The manager who I spoke to at Irvine Company Apartment Communities [ https://www.irvinecompanyapartments.com/ ] sounded as if he was reading from a script when I asked him what he was doing to put a stop to this. Was he working with Airbnb to stop this? Were insiders renting the Airbnb units themselves to determine which apartments are involved?

His answer? “Well, those would be logical ways to figure things out now, wouldn’t they?” He chuckled and then admitted that they have never tried any of these methods.

I also asked if the neighbors had been made aware of these ongoing safety issues through a mailing or any other method? Nope. Wouldn’t want to scare the residents, right?

I’m guessing that as long as the occupancy rates remain as high as possible, with cash flowing in, that managers are happy to look the other way, and this won’t be stopping anytime soon.

And what about Airbnb?

I ask for the “Verified” identification and address of my “Super host,” and they won’t give it to me. Can’t give it to me. That would break their privacy rules.

Airbnb also knows that Irvine Company Apartment Communities [ https://www.irvinecompanyapartments.com/ ] does not allow Airbnb rentals and that hosts are giving false addresses to get around the rules, but as far as I know, have done nothing to stop it.

Even people who are safety conscious could quickly be taken, hurt, or killed, but neither company seems to be taking actions to stop any of this. It would create bad press.

I asked Airbnb what people should do, and they told me if I feel unsafe to call the police. I call Spectrum back, and they told me the same thing.

But, I’m worried about others who this is happening to as well as the legitimate residents who are paying astronomical rents to live in safe, secure, gated communities that aren’t safe. What about them? And what about developments in other states that might be doing the very same thing? How can anyone ensure their safety at Airbnb or where they operate?

The whole thing leaves me feeling sick.

And, no. I still have not been refunded for my hellish apartment stay in paradise.

~LHK

Note: it seems that the word has gotten out. My host has dropped from 12 to 7 listings, and others are changing the wording or language that their listings are posted in, on their Airbnb sites. This will make it harder to spot these scammers, so use extra care when booking.

I also learned that the City of Irvine does not allow Airbnb day-to-day subletting! Why Airbnb does not remove all listings in the city of Irvine is a mystery.

Edit -this came out days after mine: I Accidentally Uncovered a Nationwide Scam on Airbnb — VICE [ https://apple.news/Al429uDHfRpqd75hSff7TmQ ]",
1,0,"When my sister and niece left after dropping me off at the Airbnb and getting a tour of her lovely home, my host showed me my room, gave me the keys and basic instructions, along with an inappropriate-feeling rash of how terrible family is, and that she’d stopped speaking to all of hers decades ago.

Except her daughter, who was off at her first year of college. The Airbnb hosting was a way to help pay for college.

All this information was given to me at surprisingly loud decibels, with her face uncomfortably close to mine.

Hmm, I thought, after she’d finally left my room and I began to unpack — hopefully she’s just a rambunctious greeter and will calm down.

Meanwhile, if that’s as bad as it gets, I suppose I can put up with that at this price, in this convenient location, with full use of the living room, kitchen and back patio in the pretty gardens.

But that was by no means as bad as it got. It kept escalating.

She yelled at me practically every time I dared venture out of my room, for eating out of a bowl that was reserved “for guests” — what was I, family? — which happened to be the only bowl in the whole kitchen that was big enough for my lunches. I had to provide my own.

She yelled at me about having trouble making her house keys work (though she’d warned me when she handed them over that they didn’t).

She yelled at me for daring to suggest turning on the air conditioner, though she was keeping the house at 83 degrees (28.3 C). She kept insisting her house had never been too hot for any other guests!

I thought better of pointing out that it had just turned hot for the first time of the year around the time I got there, and that this was her first summer hosting.

There’s no point arguing with that sort of aggression. I just dodged as best I could, reminding myself it wouldn’t be much longer.

But most of all she yelled about the fan. I sleep better with a fan in my room, for the sound as much as the air, and had borrowed one from my sister to bring over there, asking, of course, if it was alright to use it, before I brought it inside.

She assured me it was no problem at all.

I had thought I had brought the fan simply for white noise while I slept, but with the house kept at 83 degrees, frankly, I was awfully glad for the air, too.

But increasingly, she complained about the fan, as the weather got hotter and she passive-aggressively decreased the amount of time she turned on the AC.

One afternoon I intentionally left my fan on when I went out to lunch, knowing I’d be back within an hour or two, and with the room so stifling...

When I returned, my room was, yes, stifling, and I saw that she’d let herself in with her key while I was gone, and yanked the fan cord out of the wall while it was running, though the off switch was plenty large and visible.

No words necessary that time, apparently.

Then she told me her daughter was coming home from college a few days before I was due to leave, and would be sleeping with her, emphasis on the silent Since you’ll be sleeping in her room!

*Sigh* I wasn’t about to start with her at this stage of the game - only had a few more days.

She’d continually broken the contract while I’d been there, by not providing a working key, or proper air conditioning, not allowing me use of the house — in fact, increasingly, I never left my room if she was home — and now she was telling me SURPRISE!, for the last half of my stay I’d be sharing the bathroom between our two bedrooms not only with her, but with her teenage daughter.

On what unexpectedly turned out to be my last day, I was trying to nap in my room as I’d been too hot to sleep much the night before.

I was just nodding off when awoken by door slamming and stomping around. Since it kept going on, plenty loud over my fan on high, I assumed her daughter must have come home and they were doing who knows what, though I’d thought the daughter wasn’t due til the following day.

When the stomping and slamming went on for three or four hours and I didn’t hear any voices, eventually I realized, Oh, this must be a revving up of her aggression; yikes, I’m not coming out of my room for anything!

And I didn’t, till late at night when I was sure she must be asleep, though I’d had to pee for hours.

Then in the middle of the night as I was nodding off myself, suddenly she was pounding on my door and yelling, “NO! NO! NO!”

I opened the door, a bit bug-eyed, and there was her face in my face, shrieking, “YOU CANNOT RUN THAT FAN 24/7!” She complained about the cost of the fan, cost of the air conditioner.

“May I run it through the night?” I peeped, while wondering how to calm the beast for another 2-3 days, not long.

“YOU MAY RUN IT 10 HOURS A DAY!” she bellowed.

“Okay,” I whispered. “But, you know, it is increasingly hot in here now that summer’s kicked in — I’d be glad to chip in for use of the fan if that will help.”

That’s when she really lost it, kept screaming, “NO! NO! NO! YOU WILL BE OUT OF HERE TOMORROW!!! I WILL NOT BE HELD HOSTAGE IN MY OWN HOME!”

And here I’d thought it was all a matter of me taking a thousand deep breaths a day and only putting up with it a while longer.

Needless to say, after that fun night, she pounded on my door early in the morning and yelled, “TIME TO START PACKING!”.

And pack, I did, and got out, without much doubt that consciously or not, she was kicking me out so she’d have the house for just her and her daughter (as though that couldn’t have all been avoided with proper scheduling).

This was my first time ever using Airbnb. I’d hate to judge an entire company on one horrific experience, but I can’t say I’m tempted to do this again.

But anyone looking for a cheap place to stay in a convenient Los Angeles location, with cute dogs — have I got a spot for you!

All I ask in return for the tip is that you bring a giant fan.

This account — which doubles as my official review of her on the site — leaves out her darling doggies. After her seeing for the first day or two how much they enjoyed my company in my room, she kept them caged rather than allow us a minute together.

(On my bed, offering a paw to the mirror)

",
2,0,"I have a had a few as a host, and recently been thrown several curve balls. I am currently still in dispute with one guest, and seriously considering dropping out of the AirBnb game.

Things started off well enough. My first set of of guests were really nice. They accidently broke a vase, but were most apologetic, and offered to pay immediately. ( I declined, but they left a nice bottle of wine as ‘payment’ anyway.) They also left a great review.

Unfortunately this lulled me into something of a false sense of security, and I thought that all guests would be of a similar ilk. Boy was I wrong. A few weeks later Pepe and his posse from Spain landed.

He was booked to stay for 2 nights - Aug 15/16

He and his 3 friends arrived on the morning of the 15th at 08.00 am without prior warning of such an early arrival time.

I explained that they couldn't check in immediately as we had guests already who would be leaving around 11, and asked that they return at 12.00 midday.

The other guests actually checked out a bit early so we immediately began prepping/cleaning the house and rooms. A short time later we heard the sounds of 'singing' and guitar playing coming from downstairs. Pepe and friends had decided to come back early, let themselves in and treat us to an impromptu performance.

I felt a little uneasy about things at this point, but since I was new to the whole AirBnB hosting thing, I welcomed them in anyway, & showed them round the house. With the benefit of hindsight I wish I had trusted my instinct, and shown them the way out.

I live in a separate/self contained downstairs part of the house, which is probably just as well- hate to think of what may have happened if I had just left them to it.

Almost immediately there was lots of banging/shouting/arguing and more guitar playing (mine) and 'singing'. Then Pepe knocked at my door wanting use the phone. His mobile he said was broken.

He disappeared with it, and after 20 mins or so, it was so rowdy upstairs that my 7 year old son was becoming visibly upset, so I went up to see what was going on, and to retrieve my phone.

They were obviously in high spirits, & drinking spirits of the strong, distilled variety.They were also smoking. I asked them to calm things a bit, and confine the smoking to the terrace (as is clearly stated in my listing.)

Things quietened down for a short while, but then the arguing/shouting/banging/crashing kicked off again, and once more I went up to investigate. I entered the main bedroom to find a red faced very irate Pepe stomping back and forth, hurling abuse at his girlfriend who it seemed had taken refuge beneath the duvet and was trying to ignore him and sleep. I know nothing of their relationship, and I don't understand much Spanish, but my presence seemingly did nothing to stem the flow of verbal abuse in her direction, and I began to become concerned for her safety also.

After a few minutes Pepe decided to give it up and announced that he needed music and sleep. Apparently these needs would be best served in his car, and so off he went.

Peace again. But only for a short time. Shortly after lunch he reappeared, and within a few minutes the slanging match (heated arguing) recommenced.

The shouting increased in intensity and then followed several loud crashes and the sound of something breaking.

I ran upstairs to find the bed split in half, and the girl crying.

At this point I asked them to leave, then ran downstairs to take my son across to a neighbours house to ensure that he was out of harms way should the situation deteriorate further.

When I returned a few minutes later his friends were already packed and making their way out, but Pepe refused to leave until he was refunded in full. I explained that this had to done through the AirBNB channels and that obviously there was damage to my property which had to be paid for. (At that moment I was only aware of the damage to the bed but subsequently found that there was also damage to other furniture and my glass framed photography).

The argument between us became heated, and it became obvious that he wasn't going to leave except under duress, and so I decided to call the Police. (I also sent AirBnB a message alerting them to the situation via the AirBnB mobile app to which I received no response to date but we will come back to that..)

90 min later or so the Police finally arrived...

The transformation in Pepe's character was remarkable. He became quietly spoken, polite, and deferential.

Apparently much of what happened was my fault and he had only wanted a quiet rest. I hadn't heard any banging or arguing, that must have been the neighbours. The broken bed, he was insistent, simply broke while he sleeping on it.

He wasn't even having sex or anything like that and he performed a little mime of the action (both the sleeping and copulation lest we be in any doubt.)

The French police - there were 3 of them but only apparently one with a functioning brain- were impressed (actually so was I ), and seemed to be agreeing with him that it was probably because the bed was old ( I bought it new 3 years ago) and already weakened from all the previous copulatory activity that had occurred thereon. (I wish).

After much discussion they reluctantly agreed that Pepe should leave, but first I had to reimburse him for his non-stay.

At this point I had given up all hope of extracting damages for the bed, but was just desperate to get the guy, and Le Law out of my house. I explained to them that the only way I could reimburse him was through the AirBNb website, and that this was seemingly further complicated by the fact that according to AirBnB he had already 'checked in'. Pepe was insistent that he wouldn't leave until he had seen proof of cancellation. I told him to simply cancel it himself via his mobile phone, but of course as we already know that was broken..so I let him onto my computer and he logged onto AirBnb and cancelled, but then he couldn't access his hotmail account -to see the email proof of cancellation, confirmation, because hotmail was sending him a SMS log-in code which of course he couldn't receive on his non-functional mobile..

Eventually the Police woman with the brain suggested that he borrow his friends mobile, and switch sim cards.

This finally worked and finally Pepe was able to see his proof of cancellation.

There were tears and hugs as everybody said their final goodbyes. Actually I made the first and last part of that sentence up.

Finally I showed them all the door, and Pepe walked off into the sunset, at which point I realised he still had the house keys and so had to go running after him. He couldn't find them on his person or in his bags, so I (very) reluctantly had to bring him back to the house to search for them.. By this time I was beginning to feel as though I was in a Tarantino movie and this was the epilogue.

Finally he located the key, and with a level stare handed it to me.

'You know I'm an expert in Karate'

""I know"", I said. ""I've seen my bed.""

All joking aside. I think I got off fairly lightly.

A broken bed.

A broken Arabic rocking chair from my time in Dubai, of sentimental rather than great monetary value.

A broken picture frame.

Nobody hurt, physically at least.

But it sure gave me reservations about my reservations policy. I stopped taking Instant Bookings and always vet people much more thoroughly via a few emails before accepting a booking now. Even this isnt a fail safe guarantee (Pepe was a host with apparently good references,which I took note of in accepting his reservation).

In the end AirBnb didn’t do much - other than advise me to increase the amount of my security for damages deposit. And they said they had barred Pepe although I nver verified if this was indeed the case.

Since then I haven’t had anything quite as dramatic, but still a fair few incidents which I will maybe write about another time (The one where the ‘nice’ family kids painted the bedsheets with oil based non-washable paints comes to mind..) Currently as a I said at the start of this piece I am embroiled in a dispute with my last guest who took my brand new torch from the side of the fridge camping with them then ‘forgot’ to return, and are now saying they aren’t going to because they had been awoken by ‘noise’ too many times during their stay -something they had neglected to mention or complain about during the several times I enquired how the stay was going when I saw them. Who was it said ‘Hell is Other People”?..",
3,0,"“What are some of the bad experiences from Airbnb guests/hosts?”

Lazy, hands-off management.

It’d been years my relatives and I were looking forward to a family reunion here in the Land of the Rising Sun, and after a couple years of careful planning they managed to book a trip to Tokyo in the summer of 2017. With eight people to accommodate, hotels were certainly out of our budget so we naturally turned to Airbnb to search for an affordable three-bedroom condo.

Everyone arrived fairly late that evening, exhausted but safe and sound, and in a hurry as the plane had landed with some delay after a lengthy journey from France including a seven-hour layover in Dubai. It was past 11 pm and we managed to hop onto the last train bound to our destination (still having to change trains twice though), as shuttle bus service from/to the airport was already over at that hour.

We eventually made it to our destination at around midnight, everyone longing for a good night of sleep to kick off their much anticipated two-week vacations in this faraway land.

…

Okay, we’re in front of the building, now we just have to fetch the keys from this box with a four-digit passcode:

(the actual box from that night)

Let me check the booking confirmation email… okay here’s the code, now unlocking the box…

Doesn’t work. Perhaps I’ve misread the code, got the order reversed, or dialed in a wrong digit as it was already late at night and street lights were quite dim in that neighborhood. Double-checking and trying again… in vain.

…

Then I tried to give a call to the host to report the issue, and waited, waited, still waited, but nothing. Nobody would pick up the damn phone, yes it was almost 1 am but the very least you can do on a day you’re expecting guests is to make yourself available, and ensure that your guests arrive at their destination. I would understand if it were like 4 am in the morning, but having your guests board the last train and arrive at destination late at night is still a plausible scenario, and if in doubt, they could have called me directly as I was in Tokyo the whole time (I booked that place under my name and gave my contact details).

I might have tried to call at least a couple dozen times on that night.

After another half an hour of trying any means to find any clue on how to get our hands on those damn keys, short of cracking that stupid box open, we eventually gave up and decided to find another roof for that night, at least until dawn when we could hopefully get in touch with the host. My mom was exhausted from the journey, my sister was nervous on the verge of snapping and let’s not forget all the suitcases we had to carry around, under the scorching summer heat to top it all.

We walked towards the nearest major train station for a good kilometer and tried our chance in the first manga cafe we came across. While no place to have a good rest, we could at least relax in an air-conditioned room with access to fresh drinks, toilets and some entertainment to kill time until the morning.

“Eight people, is it? Let me check if there are any booths available… err, is that boy underage by any chance?”

“Yes, is there an issue with that?”

“I’m sorry but the law forbids us to serve any underage customer after 10 pm.”

“Really. Could you turn a blind eye on this for us? We’re quite desperate here after a long flight and everyone is exhausted.”

“I’m deeply sorry.”

Yep, my mom’s boyfriend’s son, aged 12, was with us. There’s nothing we could do about this unfortunately, and the Japanese clerks are especially reputed for their diligence so no much could be gained by imposing ourselves on that poor guy. So we decided to hit somewhere else… and ended up in a nearby McDonald’s for the rest of the night.

…

Come the morning, I finally got to reach someone over the phone at around 6 am. From the sound of his voice, the guy had obviously just woke up from his peaceful, unsuspecting slumber. I complained about the whole ordeal we just had to go through, and after a few words of apology from the other side, we finally got to learn that the passcode for the lock had been changed recently and it was their fault they didn’t communicate it to us. Good grief. For the record, I booked that condo two months before the actual trip, so they had plenty of time to do so, but okay, whatever, we’re all so fucking tired here so let’s just grab those damn keys for now and hit the sack already.

A few days later I got an email from the actual host, or manager; actually the guy I had on the phone was her co-worker and she was currently abroad, and deeply sorry for everything that happened. I was furious in my reply and demanded a full refund for a quarter of the rent, that is for that night we were locked out and the emotional stress we all had to endure. However, after some cooling down I sent another email that evening to reword my request, and just settle for a refund for that night only. She thanked me profusely for that “change of heart”, promised me to comply and begged me not to take this whole issue to Airbnb. Well, in retrospective, I wish I did anyway.

And that was it, a very eventful first few days, not to mention that my second sister’s boyfriend got hit by a nasty gastroenteritis merely a couple days later that had him stuck at home for the next five days so many of our plans had to be cancelled, and all the tension that was building up eventually got my first sister to snap in anger and frustration, and my mom to break down in tears one evening, but fortunately everyone quickly reconciled and just blamed it on all the misfortune that fell on us from the beginning. Everyone had tons of fun during the rest of the holidays and that’s what mattered the most.

As a parting note, while I did not take anything directly to the attention of Airbnb, I did write a lengthy review later and posted it on that room’s page, only to see its length (roughly the same as this post) trimmed to about a third, which enraged me for all the time that got wasted, but just left it at that in the end. However, I can’t help but wondering what Airbnb is trying to achieve by allowing such lazy management to happen under their name. Wasn’t their core business concept about hosts giving a warm welcome to travelers by accommodating them inside their own homes? I hope for them this was an isolated case.

Also, in retrospective I really blame myself for not having thought earlier of taking everyone to my own place that was merely ten kilometers from there, just a hop by taxi. Eight people in a one-bedroom cramped apartment, maybe, but at least everyone could more or less relax, go to the toilet or take a shower, which would have been leagues better than staying for many hours at that McDonald’s. My thoughts were clouded by everything that happened on that night. Dammit.

Thanks for reading. Peace, and have a good day.",
4,0,"I was so shocked and sad at the outcome of my experiences with airbnb. I got three separate threatening visits from the NYC DOB - Department of buildings, a government agency. They told me they needed to inspect my home as there were reports I was running an illegal hotel. I am still currently fighting the DOB for my own right to privacy. 
(this is not the illegal way to use airbnb in nyc because I live on the property while guests do and keep within time frames allotted by the city/state, and also pay hotel taxes. 
Thats not the worst of it:
I've been a host for 1 year straight, and also been a guest. I've hosted more than 150 guests from many countries and until I met lisa, I had only positive reviews. 
Now i've had creepy and weird guests but I let that go. THIS lady was a different story. ""Lisi D"" as she insisted on being called was the meanest and cruelest woman we have ever had the displeasure to be swindled by, with the help of airbnb. 
I could tell she hated me and my cute little apartment the moment she saw it. She reserved a week with me. The day after she arrived, I got an email late in the day saying that it was unlivable and terrible conditions (a bunch of lies about broken electronics and lack of cleanliness, which my own pictures and previous reviews will negate). 

2 weeks later she wrote a review on my listing. A cruel, vindictive review completely meant to destroy my business, filled with lies about things like broken appliances that were working, hair in the bed I had just freshly laundered, a dirty fridge I just bleached. She wrote that she was shocked that I didn't offer her a refund. I informed her that this was because she never cancelled her reservation and thus, if she is there or not, the week is hers and is blocked on my calendar, I cannot accept new bookings, its her reserved time. So why should she be refunded for reserving my time?

After her terrible review of my listing went live online I was forced to end my business and deactivate my listings, as that review completely killed my chance of securing other guests. Of course, she knew that. 

Then, this guest called airbnb to demand a refund for the week that they reserved and never cancelled (but decided was uninhabitable so went elsewhere). Airbnb contacted me about this several times in a very cryptic manner, asking for ""resolution"". I said that it seems resolved to me. My business is now ruined and my listings deactivated, and this person got to write her review, she paid for 7 days and never cancelled, leaving us with an active reservation and thus no ability to make money. How could I help her with problems she never voiced? She never told me about any of this until 2 weeks later. 
Airbnb was SOOO rude and unhelpful. Their general policy is that hosts and guests should resolve issues on their own. Its even hard to find their phone number. They were condescending, rude, irritable at my legitimate grievance. Despite reserving a whole week of our time, she is being refunded for 6 days (and these are days which I could not do business in)

This is all because she had ""pictures"" to prove the lack of cleanliness. I said i would also provide any and all documentation, and in the long run, if she wanted a refund, she should have cancelled to free the week, or simply told us her issues and we would have worked to solve them or even offered a partial refund. NO. She was too cruel and too unreasonable AND the airbnb staff took her side, often citing it was because she was a ""first time user"". First time user? Meaning she doesnt understand the home-stay model, doesnt know how to communicate, and expected a 5 star hotel in the middle of NYC for $89/night. Makes no sense. 

Why does she deserve a refund? She reserved a week of my time, whether or not she decided to stay (and didnt give us the chance to help her). she has pictures? I have pictures too. I was never listened to. Airbnb basically told me to stop contacting them and they made up their mind. 
So now I have to PAY my guest who RUINED my business hundreds of dollars, as it was decided by the airbnb team. 

Penalizing hosts who work in the community and follow all the rules is NOT the way to solve a problem. Thats how they just lost 4 lucrative NYC listings. 

I'll just stick to the charming family-run guest houses of the countries I backpack through for my true home-stay experience. airbnb is a business through and through, and have ZERO LOYALTY TO HOSTS. 

Hosts are money to them. A means to an end. I have never been treated so rudely by staff, nor had my legitimate grievances heard by them. 

Needless to say, I will NEVER host with them again of course. And now I feel uncomfortable and betrayed by their company, I wont be using them for travel. They refuse to take any responsibility and typically side with the guests no matter what the problem is. I've been scammed and forced to pay before but at least these scammers stayed for a night and didnt leave me a bad review. this Lisi D came and purposely to ruined my business and then demanded money. And airbnb made me give it to her.",
5,0,"When my volunteer job at a yoga retreat ended suddenly, I needed a new place to live and work. My retreat job included food and housing (thankfully), but then when the volunteer program went offline for a while, I was ejected and suddenly I found myself at financial rock bottom, with no job and no place to live. Plus no car, and living in a remote area. I will also add that this volunteer yoga job came right after I had suddenly ended an abusive marriage after an incident serious enough to call police, send him to jail for the night, take him to court and press charges.

After my term at the yoga retreat, I reserved a room at an Airbnb for a few nights as a temporary fix. When I realized how long it would take me to sort out the overwhelming stress in the situation, I needed something more long term. Even my stress had stress.

I was able to rent the room on a monthly basis. I had no idea where I would go for the near (or not so near) future, and realized that I couldn’t realistically make any decisions that I could trust, so the Airbnb thing was ideal for that, giving me some time and a temporary location while I tried to unpack everything that had happened, trying to figure out “what next?”

When I first walked into the house, I noticed that she was wearing an oversized tunic with black tights underneath. Her legs were a pair of black twigs emerging from under her oversized sweater, and her meticulously colored auburn hair was perfect. I could see she was one of “those” people - people I warned about in another post on Quora. People who are as obsessed with every aspect of their lives, and who suffer fools poorly, as they are with staying thin beyond attractiveness.

Here is what makes this tale one of those “you couldn’t make this up” stories. I will list the qualities that in my experience were worthy of a “couldn’t make this up” episode. And you really couldn’t. Make this up.

This woman, my landlord, was a perfectionist. I am well aware that this tendency is not exactly a newsflash, but this is where a slavish devotion to details went horribly wrong. She had a procedure for storing reusable plastic bags in one specific way, and would frequently demonstrate her required method of plastic bag storage. Also, she would frequently demonstrate her “correct” method of storing extra brown paper grocery bags, if she deemed my bag storage skills were slipping.

She disallowed my use of the laundry, (which had been originally included in my rent) claiming my “overly frequent” use of the washer and dryer caused her utility bill to increase. Hey, I work out daily. That makes a lot of laundry. I don’t see you running or even walking or lifting one of your pasty white skinny fingers to do anything.

In fact she was so anxious about her utility bill that when I would go out and if I hadn’t turned off the light in my room, she would run right into my room and turn off the light. I only know this because when, several times I forgot something and came back to get whatever I had forgotten and saw her turning off the lamp. If I wasn’t going out and I was sitting/working in the house, I watched her run into my room to shut down the light.

One time she mentioned random coffee grounds on her countertops and incomplete cleaning of the silverware. (Yes, I know, she might have a point there because who wants to start any mixing/slicing/juicing at a countertop with someone else’s crumbs or coffee grounds?) But… ever onward.

A couple of times in warmer, sunny weather, I used her laundry drying rack (to save money on the laundry fee) outside, where there was a lovely deck, nice and sunny. When the clothes were dry I folded it back up and put it back in the basement.

Then later she came up to me saying “You didn’t fold the drying rack correctly. Let’s go over this again so you will do it the right way next time.”

Pretty soon it was clear to me that this was a woman who was skating on such financial thin ice that any even minor increases in household expenses for her caused incredible anxiety and fearful fantasies of being homeless. It’s also the partial cause of her protective stance about her appliances since she didn’t think she could afford to repair or replace any.

Professionally, and somewhat ironically, she was a defrocked therapist. She had left her job because of “disability” with a group practice because she couldn’t deal with people, clients or coworkers. OMG the woman was on 10 meds daily.

So, to continue, when Airbnb guests were staying at her house, she insisted that they come first in everything. This meant I had to make a fresh pot of coffee every morning because she didn’t want her guests to be served from the pot of coffee I had made when I got up earlier in the am.

Once, at just about the same time as a family of guests was getting ready to leave, I came back from a run and went straight to the shower. No sooner had I started to feel that “hurts-so-good” delicious hot water beating down on my tired body, that I heard her barge into the bathroom and tell me to get out of the shower immediately because one of the guests wanted to use the bathroom before getting into their car. OMFG. Is she fucking KIDDING me??!!!

Needless to say, there were no apologies from either of us.

Speaking of coffee, since there was no garbage disposal I had to dispose of the used grounds in a bag of some sort or just wrapped up in a paper towel, and then take the used grounds to the large trashcan outside. I also later thought to dispose the used grounds in the soil where her plants were starting to grow - might be a good fertilizer.

On one of these coffee runs I spilled some coffee & grounds, leaving a stain on the driveway. With her picky picky perfectionism I seriously had to wonder if I should immediately hose down the driveway. This was just like the coffee grounds and crumbs on the counter, only not. It was outside. So I asked her. And her reply was:

“Do you really think I am that crazy?” I dodged the question by replying that I really wasn’t qualified to judge her sanity, thus ending the exchange. So maybe she wasn’t “that” crazy, but she was certainly well on her way. And dragging me with her.

The worst part about this is that I started to question my judgment as to which “offenses” were a problem for her and which ones were not, in kind of a “gaslighting” sort of way.

She kept the house at 64˚, insisting that 64˚was a perfect temp. I reminded her that 68˚, not 64˚, is defined as “room temperature” through out most of the civilized world. She just deployed her therapist-speak to say we had “different ideas” of what was a normal temp, and can’t we just get along?

And of course, in the colder months I used her space heater to keep warm, and to better work my internet job without actually shivering. Space heaters are a well-known drain on anyone’s utility bill, but she took it a step further and asked me to schedule the space heater 2 hours on, 2 hours off, rationing my use.

One time I had cut my finger and used a bandaid from my toiletries to stop the bleeding. Then, months later, she out-of-the-blue asked me if I was using her bandaids, because her bandaid supply appeared to be diminishing. Wow. Who the flock keeps track of bandaids inventory.

Another stress point: a minor one but still bat-shit crazy: She would occasionally fix chicken for her dinner, and after dinner she couldn’t throw a chicken carcass down a disposal not only because a garbage disposal cannot handle poultry bones, because there wasn’t a disposal to begin with. She would put the chicken bones in a plastic bag, put them in the trunk of her car to dispose of later at the community recycling center. She wouldn’t just right away drive the four blocks to the recycling center because she did not want to spend extra gas on a single errand. The chicken carcass might stay in the trunk for a couple of weeks, depending on when she decided to go to the recycling center.

Because of her social-worker background, when she would make requests of me she would get to her point in an oblique, indirect way, so that I would take the “hint” and do something or stop doing something as if it was my idea. My first husband and his family were like this. Instead of asking me directly to do something, instead of saying what they wanted in plain English, they would wander around the issue and wait for me to think it up myself.

Similarly, Ms. Airbnb host had a wood stove, which, if stocked with new wood and with regular supervision, would heat the whole house if it was kept going long enough. A couple of times I started the fire, but was then reprimanded for doing it wrong. So I stopped paying any attention to the wood stove, and left that up to her. Then we’d be sitting there, keeping the fire going, and she’d say “are you afraid of the wood stove?” And I would say “No”, and not elaborate, and left it at that. What she really meant, instead of asking me indirectly if I am afraid of the wood stove, was “why don’t you start the fire sometimes?”. I am not a mind reader, and if anyone wants to discuss anything with me, speak up!

After all our discussions about coffee grounds, crumbs, room temperature, etc. she began the following routine: each time I would go into the kitchen, she would come out of her room, not immediately because that would make it obvious that she was checking on me. But that was exactly what she was doing, because she would then shuffle around, pretending to look in the cupboards for for some food item, or check the outside temp, or put some more logs in the fire.

In all fairness, though, we did have a lot in common - fashion design, art, music. And when she wasn’t obsessing on something I did that she didn’t like, we actually had a sort-of friendship. She played the mandolin with an informal group of musicians and she invited me to their jam sessions. We went on walks together, went to movies together, with a couple of her friends.

During this time I needed to be gentle with myself because I was not as mentally and emotionally strong as I am used to being. In the space of the two previous years I had moved three times, so I was recovering from moving stress, bankruptcy stress, domestic abuse stress, job loss stress, all the major players in the stress playbook.

The Airbnb from hell.",
6,0,"I had a guest from Italy for 3 months. I made dinner for her when she arrived and she made a point of telling me she threw it up.(I am a good cook and have published a cook book) Two days later, her son arrived without telling me to stay the entire time. She used my address to establish permanent residency in the U.S. and to open financial accounts without telling me. She took a hammer to my quartz countertop, causing $1000 in damage and then said it was gouged by someone else (no one else was in the house). She hung her underwear on my awnings to dry because she did not like the dryer. I came home to find her building wooden displays in my living room and with cans of black spray ready to paint them in my house. She poisoned my dog deliberately and I had to spend $800 at the vet. She took my carved wooden salad spoons from Africa and used them to stir pasta and ruined them. She said that anything I cooked smelled bad and I should eat out. She threw out pieces of silverware, chef's knives, and china. She threatened to write horrible reviews about me on Airbnb if I did not drive her where she wanted to go and help her with her errands. I called Airbnb for help and they were useless. They said it was my problem. The night she finally left she poured red wine all over expensive new white linens. I found out I could not collect the deposit or the Host Guarantee because I ""did not have proof"" even though I sent 20 pages of documents and photos. Airbnb requires a police report and this is impossible to obtain in Florida because any damages caused by a ""resident"" of a home have to be brought to civil court, not the police. That was the last guest I had on Airbnb. I have made friends and helped two couples move to Miami after they stayed with me. But the risks... and what the police told me.... make it not worth it. In my opinion, Airbnb is just Craigslist with nicer photos..... I do think bad people profile people on Airbnb... she made it clear she chose me because I am single and live alone... she said that since I am unmarried people would believe any negative review she wrote about me... I spoke to a psychiatrist and he told me she sounded like a malicious psychopath... she also was incredibly racist and insisted on talking constantly about how bad everyone else is....she cooked so much smoky stuff I had to have the kitchen ceiling repainted... the list goes on and on... I wound up locked in my room with my dog, counting down the days... I offered to pay for a five-star hotel if she would just leave but she laughed and said no... I think she got a malicious pleasure out of it... and it may be okay if a man winds up with a person like this but not so for a single woman... and just so you don't think I am crazy, the two couples who I met on Airbnb and helped find houses to buy here always pick mangoes off my tree, have dog play dates, and one couple is coming for dinner on Sunday",
7,0,"I was an early AirBnB host. I had been a Couchsurfing host so when Airbnb came along, I thought it was a great option since I'd be making a little money instead of just spending money on guests who never seemed to acknowledge that reality.

I met some great people from all over the world who were lovely guests, several of whom stay in contact. However, after seveal unpleasant experiences, enough was enough! 

There was the German woman who was trying out several different neighborhoods with her husband ahead of their relocating to San Francisco. She decided raiding my cabinet and helping herself to my food to make a picnic for a friend she invited into my home without my knowledge was acceptable because she left $5 on the table. Meanwhile, they packed breakable dinnerware and flatware, cloth napkins, and my dinner for a trip to the beach. Fortunately, they left the next morning. Her American husband was at least embarrassed and apologetic.

The Japanese yoga student traveling the world who decided to take my personal yoga mat to use at a class without my permission.

The American-Chinese girl who oiled her feet then left oily footprints on  my newly professinally shampooed wall-to-wall carpeting.

But, the straw that broke the camel's back was the American woman in her 60's from Tennessee. Regularly visits her son who lives in a studio and thrilled to ginally get a reservation with me, she said she's out all day and very neat. Yes, that's great as I work from home and I expected guests to spend their days out sightseeing. Only a brief walk and then, a long bath in the shared bathroom and a long nap. She brought her own cleaning supplies and decided to clean the spotless bathroom walls one day when I was out. Okayyyy. So, it was with great surprise that on the monring she was leaving, she'd made her bed instead of stripping the sheets...until I pulled back the covers to a large red stain on the top sheet that went through the blanket. I realized then I didn't have her number. Wishing it was red wine, I knew it was blood. I'd overheard her tell her son that a wound on her knew wouldn't stop bleeding. 

Airbnb at that time shared all host's emails with their guest so , of course, she lied about the blood, saying she was unaware of it. Really?! After rummaging through my linen closet for bandages, etc.? After being so meticulous about everything else? Airbnb was no help and violated any vestige of confidentiality I though, as a host, I would have. Fortunately, the son paid for replacing the bed linens and blankets.

But, the combination of rude, clueless, self-entitled ""guests"" in my home and Airbnb's crappy resolution management was enough to insist they permanently delete my account after repeated requests to just deactivate for a time. 

As a neighbor of other Airbnb hosts, it continues to be annoying to have scarce parking spaces on the street ""reserved"" for their guests or others who just discard unwanted items, e.g. luggage, clothing, in the backyards where they remain.",
8,0,"Not exactly Airbnb but Airbnb related. I travel quite a lot and am finding quite a few Airbnb hosts are also sneakily doing regular B&b without telling people that they are just getting a room in their home and that it is not an actual B&B. (We found out they also did AIRBNB when we googled after our stays.)

We were caught out twice and both stays were mildly unsatisfactory. The first one we drove around town 3 times, as the postcode took our sat-nav to a different place to the actual address; we were also looking for a sign on the building as we thought it was a regular B&B, having booked it under that belief. As I am sure we were not the only people whose sat-nav could not find the address, that should have been made clear. Simple directions would have got us there easily. Then the ad for the place said there was parking; again, as we thought it was a regular B&b, we expected, you know, parking. Not trying to cram our car onto a postage-stamp sized patch without 1) being partly on the path where we’d be ticketed 2) hitting the side of the owner’s house 3) dinging the suspension on our low car getting over the great big curb 4) ramming this metal rod the landlady had sticking out of the fence through the radiator…

She watched as my OH was trying to park without a disaster and said loudly, “Oh, is he new to driving?’ Cheeky…no, he was just freakin’ stressed because we’d driven several hundred miles, gone round the busy town up 2 huge hills three times, had to ask in a local business where her house was (even the locals didn’t know—they had to do a search on Google Earth!) Fortunately the room itself was fine and everything ok from then on.

The second time, once again we had a problem finding the place. The postcode took you a mile up the street. Trying to phone the owners got no answer; a few minutes later they phoned us back…and when my OH answered…they hung up, so he had to call them again! Anyway, we finally got to the place to find that the promised parking there was on their drive…Oh, but we are told we better NOT park there as someone else was coming and we might ‘get boxed in.’ (We were attending an event early the next day.) Our alternative—the public lane. In front of a gate. That sorted (sort of) we were taken to our room; nice and clean but…it was not ensuite. Nothing on their advert mentioned this at all and it was certainly not a cheap place. Most places that do not have ensuite rooms tell you upfront as they don’t want complaints. I occasionally have a medical issue which could have been very embarrassing. And the room itself, although very tidy…no TV…although they had a plug for an aerial….and no lock on the door! Very, very basic for what we paid and although these two places were both listed under B&B, there was no breakfast included.",
9,0,"I had an experience recently that wasn't bad, but I felt the guest was intentionally vague, and I wasn't sure how to help prevent it happening in the future with other guests without seeming completely insensitive.

I had a booking request from a woman who was travelling to NY with her teenage daughter. After a few rounds of emails with questions asked and answered, the mother indicated that her daughter had a 'slight' disability, and sometimes used a wheelchair (folding) but really only when tired. I immediately replied that my listing was most definitely not wheelchair accessible and that the house was not handicap-friendly. Steps to enter the house, staircase to the guest rooms, no handrails in bathrooms, etc. The guest replied that this was no problem at all, the daughter could walk, had no other issues at all, just used the chair when tired. She also indicated that the daughter really loved the pictures, and knew exactly the situation. She had her heart set on this listing. Fine - booking processed.

Mother and daughter show up, get settled, and then immediately call me. Can I please move some of the furniture so that the chair can have better access? Sigh. Yes. Next day - can we take one of your chairs (Jackson metal tub chairs) into the shower, as the daughter needs to sit down to bathe. Sigh. No. Back I go with a plastic chair. On and on with special requests all week, which I obliged, although begrudgingly, because I felt bad for the young girl who just wanted to have a vacation in New York. In the end, we had a broken toilet handle, two broken towel rods (she was using the towel rod to support her weight) that I'm having a tough time replacing, and tire marks all over the floor that had to be scrubbed away.

The reason for my ire is that I feel the mother intentionally misled me regarding the severity of her daughter's condition so that I'd accept the booking, and then once she was in place, guilted me into making various concessions that I would not normally have had to make.... and in the process, putting her daughter through more of a headache than needed. I wish that there was a place in the review process that was something like ""important info for future hosts"" that was not visible to public, only to hosts. At least in this way I could have made some notation other than the option of replying No to the 'would you recommend this guest'.",
10,1,"As great of a momentum Airbnb has, it sure has few threats. 

Yes, it is becoming a behemoth and is no longer a start-up considering its resources and valuation. But they are also in a field of milti-billion if not trillion dollar travel industry, so they are still relatively small. 

We've been analyzing AirBnB's competition for quite some time, and this is what it looks like as of now, end of 2015.

Most of the people tend to think that these are the main competitors: 

1. HomeAway (owns VRBO) which indeed was acquired by Expedia is somewhat a threat but if you analyze the growth and the ""cool"" factor we don't think Airbnb has to worry about it too much. Especially now that it will be run by even a bigger corporation such as Expedia. After all, when was the last time you thought of Expedia as the main site to book your stay? Or, when was the last time you went on H [ http://homeaway.com/ ]omeAway instead of Vacation Rentals, Homes, Apartments & Rooms for Rent - Airbnb [ http://airbnb.com/ ] to look for a short time stay? Ask people around who they think of then they think of the short time rental stay. Homestay's stock wasn't performing too well before the acquisition, either.
2. There are sites like flatbook and onefinestay and the likes, but as of now it looks like they are still trying to expand and quite possibly losing money just to grow and scale. We think Airbnb can easily put them out of business.
But we think that these two categories pose a much larger threat: 

1. Hotels. They have the scale and the money. And, obviously, while Airbnb disrupted the field, it looks like they are preparing to strike back. Not only did they start competing price-wise and stepped up their marketing efforts, they are also both growing and changing their business models. In our hometown Chicago alone, they saw an increase of 8.3% revenue for the firs 10 months of 2015 compared with 2014) setting another revenue record. Here's the recent article: Downtown hotels wrapping up another record year [ http://www.chicagobusiness.com/realestate/20151130/CRED02/151139988/chicago-downtown-hotels-wrapping-up-another-record-year ]. Also, they are changing their format to be more like Airbnb: Meet the Hotels That Want to Look Like Airbnb Rentals [ http://www.slate.com/blogs/business_insider/2015/08/21/extended_stay_hotels_try_to_compete_with_airbnb_by_adding_luxury_livability.html ]. On such scale, this could be a game changer with time.
2. Cities / regulations / taxes / licenses / regulations. We think this is one of the biggest obstacles not just for Airbnb but for homeowners / hosts. Just think how Proposition F almost destroyed Airbnb on its home turf. Also, consider how NYC is going after multi-unit owners who are turning their apartment buildings into Airbnb hostels of sorts. Here in Chicago, the city is cracking down on rentals as well. On top of mandatory hospitality tax, there is also a ""hostel / bed and breakfast"" licence hosts have to pay. Chicago cracking down on Airbnb [ http://wgntv.com/2015/11/23/chicago-cracking-down-on-airbnb/ ]. If Airbnb short term rentals categorized as Hostels / Bed and Breakfasts, this can not only slim down the profit margins but cause unnecessary safety inspections / taxation, which will discourage people from hosting.
This is just a short list of the main threats and competitors as I see it. I'd appreciate any feedback.

The price is the same, the availability calendar is the same, the photos are the same (unless the verifies photos). Everything is the same. But as you can see, there is a huge difference of performance.

I checked how many rentals were done in Orlando, where I have a  property, and the number, summing all the rentals done by Roomorama so  far is 31 (December 31st 2012), including my unique rental done over there. This number was almost half of the number that I had myself with Airbnb in that time!!!

Maybe, what I said in the beginning of this message is wrong. There is one competitor to Airbnb: Itself. If Airbnb starts to provide bad services or decrease the quality  and the quantity of the features that right now are being provided, it may push the customers to other sites.

In beginning, the 24/7 support they had more ""power"" (at least it is my personal feeling). Now they are forwarding some requests to level 2 and some issues that in the past was able to solve in the same call or transfer to the correct departments or person now it is being ""escalated"" to the correct support team. 

This is not jeopardizing the quality of the the service so far, but if the trend is kept, the other may have a room to increase.

In beginning, the photos taken by Airbnb photographers were uploaded to the the listing in just 2 or 3 days after taken. Now it is taken up to 3 weeks.

In beginning, they used to offer the ""Verify Address"" and they stopped now. They also reward some hosts with a SuperHost status, but this is no longer available for new application. In both cases Airbnb is no longer accepting new application and I think it is unfair with new users.

In beginning, they used to call to followup for a request/ticket open. Now they only send an email. I think a phone call is much better and all the conversation could be recorded and kept with the history of the request, at the same way that is done with the messages.

However, a lot things happened since the beginning to now. The ""Call this guest"" feature is something that was implement and it is really cool. That is help to the guest verify his/her phone number.

The statics  (plot)  inside ""Manage List"" has been improved.

Airbnb can be classified as a vacation rental site or as hotel alternative or whatever you want. In my opinion the classification does not matter. The most important thing is his performance to bring rentals to the owners and offers good stays to the guests with a good price/quality ratio.

So, the big challenge, in my opinion, is not bit the competitor is to keep the leadership alone, because there is no competitor for USA market. But if Airbnb decrease the quality, I think they will loose a huge market very fast.",

13,1,"Hello there,

I going to tell you one surprising fact, that AirBNB was not the first one to come up with the Idea of Vacation Rentals, where AirBNB came in the year 2008, whereas VRBO currently owned by HomeAway was the first one to come up with the idea in the year 1995 , but AirBNB was the one who executed Idea better than them, they were the one who marketed it better than them, and the result is the number of people knowing about AirBNB is far more than the number of people know about HomeAway, and there are not only two of them, today the space is jammed packed, even many giants in travel and hospitality business have stepped in space like TripAdvisor with FlipKey and more.

And I know your question is not why AirBNB is better than its competitors, but I wanted to put my point, and there is no better place than quora, so… you know…

Here is the list of competitors for AirBNB with there USP:

 * HomeAway; Probably it is the biggest competitor of AirBNB, and parent to many other vacation rentals, founded in the year 2005 and has over 2 Million Listed place available in 190 Countries.
 * Tripping.com: It is a kind of Google for Vacation rentals, generally known as a deal aggregator, they don’t have their own listing portal but allows to list or book places form a different site like HomeAway, booking.com, Wimdu, homestay etc. and this makes it the largest database of vacation rentals with over 10 million places to choose from.
 * FlipKey: It was the lucky startup acquired by TripAdvisor, the largest player in the travel and hospitality business, the number of listed property is far lesser on other platforms but for a good reason, they believe in quality over quantity, as the listing is not open, a person has to send a request for listing, which will be followed by the visit from a person form FlipKey who will analyze the place, take photographs and then it will appear on the site, so the guest will get the most accurate description of the place.

14,1,"With so many vacation rental websites out there today, it can be difficult to figure out the best place to list your property. Conducting a quick Google search will result in a variety of specialty websites such as:
 
The Apartment Service (www.theapartmentservice.com)
At Home Abroad, Inc. (www.athomeabroadinc.com)
Great Rentals (www.greatrentals.com)

Rentalo (www.rentalo.com)
Sea2Sky Vacation Rentals (www.sea2skyvacationrentals.com)
Vacation Home Rentals (www.vacationhomerentals.com
Villas International (www.villasitnl.com)
 
It is not uncommon to see property managers listing their properties across ten or more of these outlets.  But times are changing, and a consolidation of the bigger sites has created five main players.  

Airbnb [www.airbnb.com]
FlipKey [www.flipkey.com]
HomeAway [www.homeaway.com]
VacationRentals. [www.vacationrentals.com]
VRBO [www.vrbo.com]
 
 
A Cost Comparison [ http://.../ ]
 
The revenue model for vacation rental websites had been the same for the 15 years before Airbnb arrived. Property owners (hosts) would buy annual subscriptions to several individual vacation rental websites.  Serious hosts would pay for “upgraded” listings to improve their visibility by highlighting their ad at the top of the search results.  These premium listings promise up to “4x more booking” for a hefty fee.
 
For example, a basic listing with HomeAway is $349, but a premier listing goes for nearly $1,000.  These traditional websites all employ the same tactics to upsell their users. Get people to sign up for a basic listing and then blame their lack of success on the lack of investment in their ad. 
  
Airbnb entered the market and saw a way to grab market share by charging nothing up front and taking fees only when bookings were confirmed.  

Here’s a quick comparison of the fee structures for the five largest sites. 



 HomeAway responded to the threat of Airbnb by offering a pay-per-booking option. The fee is 10% of each booking, which is cheaper than Airbnb overall, but you can expect to have your listing buried under the hundreds of other premium-paying subscribers in your city. 

Seeing the success of Airbnb, FlipKey (by TripAdvisor) also entered with a similar pay-per-booking option to try to get in on the action.  FlipKey has a great user interface and strong financial backing, but they continue to struggle gain new members.
 
Traditional Fixed Fees vs. Per Booking Pricing [ http://.../ ]
 
Let’s take $500 as the average price of a reasonably well-positioned listing on HomeAway or VRBO.  It is interesting to see where the break-even point is between a $500 fixed-fee listing and an Airbnb pay-per-booking fee of 3%.
 

 
The graph shows that if you are expecting to earn less than $15,000 dollars per year on your vacation rental then Airbnb looks like an obvious choice.
 
But, remember, that Airbnb is charging fees to the host AND the guest. It is important to look at the total cost of rental from the customer’s perspective.  Guest fees range from 6% (for more expensive stays) to 12% (for cheaper stays).  Let’s take 8% as the fee the average guest incurs and again see what the break-even point is when taking all of the service fees into account.
 
 
 
 
Over the course of a year these fees become substantial. Listing your place with Airbnb will cost more if you are expecting as little as $5,000 in bookings, and will cost you an additional $1,000 for every $12,000 in booking you receive throughout the year. 
 
So… why would I list my properties with Airbnb when I’m expecting over $150,000 in bookings this year!!??  
 
In one word: FREEDOM

I spend an average of 2-hours per week managing each apartment. Airbnb allows me to leverage my time so effectively that I am now netting over $400 per hour. Airbnb is not competing on price, it is competing on VALUE.
Unlike a traditional vacation home rental market where owners were looking to have longer term stays with relatively few well-screened guests. Airbnb has switched the paradigm by creating a less restrictive, more dynamic marketplace. By handling transactions, allowing for instant bookings, and streamlining the reservation process, the website allows for a higher volume of bookings for an ever- increasing variety of accommodations.   
With all this being said, it is important to note that Airbnb is not the right option for everyone. 
 
For instance, HomeAway or VRBO might be better primary options for you if you are planning to:
 
·      Rent a high value home (over $500 a night)
·      Rent to long-term tenants (over a month) 

I do recommend that if you use VRBO or HomeAway for longer stays, that you complement it with an Airbnb listing to help book the gaps in-between longer stays.

15,1,"To me, none of Airbnb's existing competitors (HomeAway, VRBO, etc.) in the home vacation rental market even count as competition. These services existed before Airbnb and with superior UX, talent, and funding, Airbnb has been able to race by all of them to essentially define the home vacation rental market. I feel the gap between Airbnb and its currently viewed ‘competition’ is still widening (fast).

The biggest competition to face Airbnb has yet to emerge in a significant way but it will be from Booking.com [ http://Booking.com ].

While Booking.com specializes in hotels - its really in the accommodation market and with several tweaks to its app - it could easily enter the 3 home verticals Airbnb specializes in - ‘Bed’, ‘Room’, or ‘Entire Place’.

How Booking.com poses the biggest threat is that it currently boasts superior distribution. Booking currently operates in 221 countries and gets 900k daily room reservations. There is no other platform that comes close.

Now imagine Booking expanding its listings to include the home rental market. Users get a marketplace where the full stack of accommodation possibilities are presented in one place and landlords get exposure to a wider audience.

At the end of the day - it’ll be distribution who dominates this market - not fees or pricing. If its easier to rent rooms on Booking.com - that’s where landlords will go.

In fact, if you travel to Europe - many ‘Entire Place’ listings on Airbnb are often found as ‘Apartments’ on Booking.com. While Booking.com and Airbnb may not be mentioned side by side just yet - I think the battle between the two is just beginning.",
16,1,"A competitor competes for access to a few resources with you. Investors. Talent. Customers.

However for a growth company like Airbnb, a competitor would be a company that's growing in the same marketplace at the same speed.

It took me a while to understand why Facebook, Google and Apple would be competitors even though they work on different products. They're competing for the full attention of their users and harvesting the most data.

In this case, I'd argue the prize is the complete travel itinerary of the guest. PriceLine. Expedia. Ctrip.",
17,1,"It depends on the market you are working in. I am based in Hong Kong and have a lot of visitors from China. In China there are local competitors like Tujia.com, but they don't have an English interface yet, and you may need a Chinese cell phone number to register, so I haven't tried them yet. The only alternative I have found which sometimes works is Craigslist. I had some enquiries from booking.com but no bookings. It's important to diversify and not rely on one platform because Airbnb can remove your listings at any time without having to give a reason as recently happened to me.
Airbnb can pull the plug on your lettings business at any time, they do not have to give any reason as you will see if you read your terms and conditions carefully.",

They have both the capital and the expertise necessary to scale quickly, and it is much easier for them to gain a foothold in European markets due to their location and access to European talent.

AirBnB have already acknowledged this by sending out an email to their entire user base warning them of 'impostors', and by buying another German clone to establish their presence in Europe.",

20,2,"I feel obliged here to give some warnings to women who travel alone and decide to stay in Airbnb or any kind of private rentals: stay vigilant.

I was trusting of other people before I had this incident. I used Airbnb during my Hawaii trip in December 2015. My overall experience was pleasant until I met host R. Oconner in the northwest of Oahu Island, where the nightmare started. Like other hosts, he tried to establish rapport with me by talking and sharing his hobbies with me. I was unguarded after staying with him for two days. We connected on FB and I revealed my personal information and trip plans to him, getting suggestions and recommendations. So when he offered to meet me in Maui Island (my next stop after Oahu) and to give me a tour while he was there for the holidays, I gladly accepted. I gave him a five-star review on Airbnb, and I also give him a ride to the Airport the day I left his place. However, after meeting him in Maui, he took me to his friend’s house in the woods, and sexually assaulted me that night. I was able to get rid of him later and stayed in a Hostel the rest of days. I didn’t report this to the police until one day prior to my departure of Maui, intimidated by the thought that he might come after me since he knew where I was staying.

The story doesn’t have a happy ending. Like 90% of sexual assault cases, the detective who was assigned to my case didn’t even get statements from the offender or his friend involved in the case, because he said it was a “he said she said case”. I felt the humiliation and rage I had when I gave my statement describing the details were consumed. In thinking back, it was so obvious that it was premeditated, and I wasn’t smart enough to read the hints until it was too late. He made sure that I gave him a good review before he did anything bad to me, so he wouldn’t harass any people during their official stays; He asked me to share the expense of a rental car he used in Maui before he did anything bad, for he did not have to assume any economic loss; he acted like a friend and added me on FB, but removed me from FB and blocked my phone number soon after the attack, etc.. I would not know he was ill-intended without this experience. As a host, he has a decent job and owns a nice townhouse and a car, doing a part-time master’s degree, just like any aspiring professionals I would meet in the city. How could I tell?

Moreover, I could not revise my Airbnb review to warn incoming female guests to his place. I submitted a report about the host to Airbnb but never heard back from them. To be fair, Airbnb is just a middleman between hosts and guests. Safety responsibility lies on each individual.

Just keep in mind that, if traveling alone as a female, try to stay with a female host or a couple. Airbnb reviews are not always reliable since most of the reviews are five stars. It is really hard to use them to screen hosts.",

security tips to consider before booking on Airbnb

If you want to find accommodation during your next trip at economical prices, you may want to rely on Airbnb.

Airbnb is the world 's [ https://aitnews.com/tag/%D9%85%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%B9/ ] largest online rental and home rental website for local residents, with nearly 4 million homes around the world in 191 countries and 65,000 cities.

Despite the site's wide popularity, some users may feel anxious and insecure due to housing concerns with local residents who rent their own homes through the site.

So here are 5 tips you should consider before booking on Airbnb for a safe experience while you travel.

1.Do not deal outside the site

When you make a reservation from the site, do not respond to any attempt to contact the host “homeowner” outside the site, whether to obtain more details or to complete the payment process.

The site provides you with all safe ways to complete the payment process, as well as communicate effectively with the homeowner to inquire about any details and without the need to reveal your information, as only the general information that you put in your profile will appear to the owner.

The site allows you to request a refund within 24 hours of your arrival in case you encounter any major problem, as long as everything is done through the site.

2.Check reviews and host profile

It is always preferable to take a more in-depth idea of ​​the host by reading his personal information as well as the reviews left by the tenants before you and their satisfaction with the service and the behavior of the homeowner.

Often, dealing with hosts with previous positive experiences and high ratings will ensure a safe experience and avoid any surprises with untrustworthy hosts.

Airbnb also provides the ability to verify identity, by attaching a government ID card and linking it to the host's account, so the tenant can rest assured that the host's identity has been officially verified.

A host who has linked his personal identity, social media accounts and phone number you can trust when booking on the site.

3.Contact the host early

You can communicate with the host through private messages on the site and introduce yourself to him and inquire about any information or things you want.

It is important to check the arrival times and their suitability to the host's schedule, you do not want to arrive in town and spend time communicating with the host in vain, so do not leave anything to chance and arrange and coordinate every detail with the host.

And to ensure a safer experience, you can ask the host to communicate with another person in the event that you are unable to communicate with him for one reason or another, and that there will be someone to communicate with you regardless of the presence of the host or not.

4.Prepare for emergency

Even if everything is perfectly arranged, emergency events are possible when you travel to another city, so be prepared for any emergency by relying on a back-up plan when you are unable to reach the host or there is a problem with your accommodation.

And remember that getting to a certain house is not as easy as getting to a hotel in the city, so on the way to the accommodation keep your eyes open for the main landmarks so you always know where you are while you are in the city.

Important tips before booking from Airbnb

1. Do not deal outside the site for any reason when you make the reservation. You have one way to confirm the payment process, which is the site only, even if the owner is the same. The site did not leave any other details for you to inquire about, so do not make yourself vulnerable to fraud.
2. Review the host's profile by reading his personal information with the reviews left by the tenants about him and the way he was treated, in addition to his behavior in providing the services that were announced, this research adds some security to you.
3. Make sure your host's watch is right, so you don't spend too much time communicating with him when you arrive, or even if he's out of the house, you don't have to wait too long.
In a nice way, you can ask the host to make a backup person for you to communicate with while the original host is not there.
4. Make a backup plan in case anything happens that makes you not get the housing, or reach it in the first place, then look for places nearby that can receive you in case of emergency.
5. Indeed, reaching a house is completely different from reaching a famous hotel, so pay attention to the description and do not indulge in recreation with the sights so that it does not cost you much.
6. There is a so-called third-party booking scam, meaning that the booking is made through another company as an Airbnb booking broker and then the money is defrauded easily, so register through the site itself and of course I pay through it only.
7. And be aware of the site's warning that they are not responsible for a reservation made through a third party because it violates their privacy rights, as well as canceling the reservation and banning both the broker who made the reservation, and the guest himself.
How secure is Airbnb booking and how to report a scam

According to the reviews of the guests and the wide popularity of Airbnb without major complaints that harm its reputation, in general, the reservation is safe, given the many procedures imposed by the site’s management on all advertisers through them, which gives them good credibility.

Report fraud before payment on Airbnb You can report through messages on the site, click on the conversation icon that contains the suspicious

message, and inside the message, click on the flag icon,

choose the reason for reporting this person, then click on Next, and

in case you want to block this person’s messages, press Yes, click Block now

22,2,"Well i think that much like Uber, any app that connects ‘normal’ people in a transactional way has the same statistical probability of there being a nutcase involved as for example taking public transport or attending college. So I suppose the real question to ask is what sort of vetting Airbnb do and how effective they are at weeding out the nutters and addressing any issues that might arise should you end up having to deal with a nutter as your host.

That’s not a question I’m qualified to answer as I have only extensive experience as a guest.

That aside - I normally rent the whole apartment and on the occasions when I have rented a share situation, I have done so as a man and normally with my wife - and so far - so good. Reading some of the other responses here it is clear that the experience of a single woman is something totally removed from my own experiences and I express my regret and sympathy for the traumatic situations they have found themselves in.

So from my limited perspective then as a male, over 40’s traveller - is Airbnb safe? 100% yes. In Moscow its a little bit rock and roll but they get there in the end. In Mexico it is unbelievable value - as it is in Florence and Verona. In New York it is controversial as it is in Valencia. (There seems to be some kind of issue with legal status and tax so hosts ask you not to make it explicit you are an Airbnb guest).

I tend to look for properties that have reviews from families or people that have written other reviews to compare with, and also reviews that comment in detail or downsides and don’t just offer rave 5 stars. In my experience too good to be true is more of a risk than small niggles.

Hope that helps.",
23,2,"Booking an AirBnb is a risk. Your AirBnb experience will really depend on your host, not AirBnb. Guests must fully vet the host to have an idea of whom they’re doing business with before booking.

Airbnb is an option, it may be your only option, but it shouldn’t be your first option for travel.

Maybe you checked in to your AirBnb with no issues. A few days into the stay, the host’s landlord is at the door telling you you need to leave ASAP because the host is illegally subletting and they’re behind on the rent. How would you feel if you had a host mislead you like that?

Or maybe you booked an entire house to attend Formula One months in advance. Within a few days of checkin, your booking is canceled because the host is a commercial operator running a full time AirBnb in a residential neighborhood*, and the neighbors got it shut down. You’re out of a place to stay and everything else is booked. You don’t have these problems when booking a hotel.

If you’re just visiting extended family for the holidays, and are not staying anywhere touristy like Times Square or a ski resort, go to the hotels that are situated near business parks. No business traveler is there around that time and the rates are very good.

I personally do not recommend booking an AirBnb during the holidays, especially in urban areas. Many hosts close their listings so they can take a break. The ones who are open are priced much higher, or are already booked. Business traveler hotels during holidays are far cheaper than AirBnb, along with daily housekeeping, insurance, safety exits, breakfast, nice beds & showers.

Also, do you REALLY need a kitchen? Why not save top dollar on an entire house listing by sharing half a house with onsite hosts? If you must AirBnb, only book with the homeowner with their primary residence, they don’t list multiple listings.

If booking private room, make sure the host lives there and is the homeowner. Don’t book private room listings where the host takes in multiple reservations at the same time, pick those that host one reservation at a time. Private rooms set up as mini hostel are not as safe or clean because of multiple guests coming and going. Pick private room listings where you have a private bath. 

And for heaven’s sake if you know your child is going to an AirBnb house party, don’t let them go! Chances are they’re going to get shot.

*There is a major difference when renting an entire house of the primary homeowner’s residence versus renting an entire home run by a commercial operator who has the entire home listed available to rent as a short term rental 360 days in the year. The latter you should not book!

All the problems with parties and scam listings you’ve heard about are a result from commercial operator listings. You should not book with commercial operators because of the nuisance and safety issues they bring to the neighboring properties. Entire home listings by real homeowners who live in the area do not list their entire house all the time and every weekend, therefore, unlikely to have problems with the guests and the neighbors.",
24,2,"I hope you enjoyed your trip :) Having been a guest in 9 countries, and hosted people from just as many nationalities, I have a simple answer to your question:

Airbnb is as safe as you make it.

Safety is a huge focus [ https://www.airbnb.com/trust ] for Airbnb, and even with the safety measures in place, bad things [ http://www.oddee.com/item_99421.aspx ] have, and will continue to happen. But just as you know that it's better to walk in a group at night, or to wear your safety belt when you drive, there are numerous features baked into Airbnb that help make your stay with someone as safe as possible.


Here are some tips:

1. Check for excellent reviews
The best way to tell whether a guest or host is going to be any good is to check what their previous behaviour was like; and the best way to do this is to look at reviews.

It is possible that someone could game Airbnb (e.g. by staying with people they know), but the greater the number of reviews, and reviews from various countries, the lower the chance that someone has been / or intends to be dodgy. 

If you care about your safety, then take some time to read the reviews.  




2. Check for badges
On each Airbnb page, you will find a 'Trust' section. In this trust section you will be able to see if someone has verified their ID (e.g. drivers license / passport), how many reviews total they've had, and whether they are so good that they've been rated by guests as being a 'super host'. 



3. View the guest / host's profile
If you click on a person's image you'll be taken to their profile page where you'll be able to read a personal profile written by the person, see how long they've been registered with Airbnb, along with details of what they've verified with Airbnb. If anything looks amiss with this information, then perhaps you should reconsider staying with this person / having them stay with you.




Aside from these main tips, you also have the chance to contact and interact with people before either of you confirm a booking. As a host, you are also insured [ https://www.airbnb.co.nz/guarantee ] up to $1,000,000 should anything end up happening to your home / apartment. 

My last piece of advice, is to keep Airbnb's Customer Service Phone Number [ https://www.tripping.com/industry/rental-companies/airbnb-customer-service ] handy in case something does happen. In the case that a host falls over last minute, Airbnb staff will actively start calling around to see if there's another host you could stay with - they're pretty good like that ;)",
25,2,"Next month, It will be 4 years since my first Airbnb experience which was in Maui, Hawaii. Since then I have stayed in numerous Airbnbs in 9 US states and 2 foreign countries.

Safety is all about doing your homework and being prepared. Of course, as a single woman there are more steps needed to be taken to ensure safety but in general here are the things I look for when deciding where to book:

1. Is there an entire apartment/house available in my budget and location with what I need?
2. 
1. If Yes, then ignore the shared ones right away and go further down your options.
2. If no, then you have 2 options. Either increase your budget and try or go to next steps of pruning down the shared accommodations.

3. How many photos are available?
4. 
1. Look only for relevant photos. Photos of views, neighborhoods, misc things are helpful but only if in addition to clear pictures of the house itself.
2. If not too many photos are available but other factors are good, try contacting the owner asking for more photos.

5. How are the reviews?
6. 
1. Here, the number of reviews and types of reviews matters. Who wrote them, do they look automated/overly raving, do they have too many typos?
2. Again, this is not a major factor and can be ignored if the other factors give you a good vibe. I have stayed at several properties with zero reviews but the owner was very responsive before making the booking.

7. What is the cancellation policy?
8. 
1. This is an important factor because sometimes you need to make the booking quickly for fear of losing out or lack of inventory. But this is important because if the host is unresponsive, you have time to back out. The easier the cancellation, the safer you are to evaluate after making the booking and cancelling if needed.

These 4 factors are only related to safety and assuming you know how to prune based on other factors such as availability of amenities, walking score, luxury level etc.

And lastly you need to trust your gut. If all looks well before but seems off when you arrive, depending on the severity, either walk out and get a hotel or call Airbnb as soon as possible.",
26,2,"Airbnb is perfectly safe and good value for money. It gets you planning for that trip from A to B with so many unknowns taken care of that well you can really focus on the trip.

All the best to them for their current warehoused ‘experiences’ . It will eventually take off, but the challenges on Airbnb remain the same, and it is not a hassle free experience but the horror stories you hear would happen more frequently in any other mode used to book stays especially those pricey hotels where you end up with a booking coupon in hand.

What one must understand about the Airbnb experience is that the superhosts or even ordinary hosts have worked hard to get the value of the place to a reasonable number and they sink their own money into it. Secondly, you have to understand that in places like China (and I suspect Eastern Europe) apartment living and subletting is really for the nouveau rich and they have no idea what they are required to do on the platform. Even in a middle income country like India (my home) Airbnb has great options in cities like Ahmedabad and Hyderabad (that I have used).

My solo questionable experience on Airbnb was when I traveled to China and because the flight landed at midnight, when I eventually reached the right spot without Google and without any knowledge of Chinese (having relied on Google) the host refused to turn up at the night and i had to stay in the same building with a different Bed and breakfast ( and was duly compensated by Airbnb later) within a reasonable budget

My first Airbnb stay was in New York - Long Island where the host was sweet and waited up for me till mid morning as the international flight landed into the wee hours (and lo and behold this time the car rental counter took me two hours to get my prebooked car) The basement was converted into a luxury pad, with towels, coffee, some breakfast including fresh bread and everything I needed in the shower and the toilet. Elaine was very nice to me and the college I was visiting was a hop over from the apartment, under 3 miles of driving , made the stay even more delightful.

My last stay using Airbnb (as of writing) was in Melbourne, and I had a downtown apartment right above the city streets and a small hop away from College / Office. I had another block at Bundoora where I stayed next to the University and I had no problem getting in despite the flight being at night. Pleasurable stays, homely coffee with the hostess and a well stocked lair for the urban traveller, seems too good to miss. Cancellations are quick and painless, as long as you look up terms and I have never needed more than emails on Airbnb to get the job done.

I have a couple of stays to come using Airbnb this year, including one in the most expensive city in the world, and I look forward to using it very often in my remaining stay on Planet earth, as it is the elixir to make friends and stay unmindful of all the artificial travel hassles. Of course that means being ready for a bad moment or misunderstanding but its still better than spending days without any cash to spend at hotel bars all alone, with worries about credit card bills to pay back home. Also it is a good idea to get a Power bank in your cabin baggage and buy a local SIM at each airport you land. These are very cheap and wifi speeds are great at airports. Also the seats have USB chargers all through the flight. Travel safe.",
27,2,"I'll start this on a personal note. I travelled to Europe in March and stayed in two Airbnbs. It was awesome. Better than 300 dollar a night hotels. Did I mention how much cheaper it was? 

Airbnb (product) [ https://www.quora.com/topic/Airbnb-product ] is very safe. To be frank, if you are smart about it, I would say as safe as a hotel.

I make two simple rules before staying in an Airbnb:

1. The location must have 3 or more reviews, with none of those reviews stating a negative experience.
2. The host and I must talk via Airbnb; if I feel iffy at all, I would like to add the host on Facebook (product) [ https://www.quora.com/topic/Facebook-product ] as well. 

This ensures a personal connection with the host. You know who their friends and family are (not meant to be in a threatening way). Also, the prior reviews are enough to justify that you will have a good experience at this particular location. Make sure that you are also happy with the location of the Airbnb and the pictures of the location. 

The problems, which are far and in between, come into play with Airbnb when people do not do their due diligence concerning a guest or a host.

Let's say you follow these basic guidelines and have a horrible experience. I would make sure you have the following:
 * A mobile phone
 * The local police's number (911 equivalent)
 * Airbnb's safety hotline number
 * A backup hotel to stay at, the money to pay for it, and the transportation to get there
 * A copy of your reservation at this Airbnb location

If you are still feeling iffy, I would suggest checking out http://www.airbnb.com/safety. This shows how seriously Airbnb takes safety.",
28,2,"I have never tried AirBnB but I did with Couchsurfing and it’s quite similar in a way. 
I’m just gonna tell you a story of what happened when I wanted to stay 2 nights in Geneva for a job interview.

I went on couchsurfing with a new account because I lost the password for my previous account (long story short the email backup was blocked and I couldn’t remember the password), so my profile appeared like a new one, but I still verified it. 
I was planning to stay 2 or 3 days in Geneva, including one day for the job interview. I asked some hosts if they were available and finally found one. His profile was quite funny, he had many reviews almost all positive (and one where he cancelled the thing). 
He said he was available on that date and offered to start talking through Whatsapp rather than Couchsurfing. I was OK with that and boy I’m glad I did so. 
At first, he was very normal, asking me what I was doing and why I went to Geneva, what I’d like to do in my free times, etc. But very quick, he started telling me he has a lot of money and is currently travelling somewhere in Greece or whatever. I was like “ok I don’t care but I don’t mean to be rude”. He sent me pics and I would just answer with emoji (I’m not a very chatty person). 
After some days of chit chats, he started being odd and telling me he’d like “different” stuff than most of people, telling me about his one night stands and S&M/bondage evenings he would do. He also sent me pics that he took from Google image of women dressed for these “parties” etc. 
I was feeling uncomfortable and said nothing about these as I thought he was joking. After a couple of times of this, I told him I was not interested in staying in his place anymore and I didn’t want to know what he expected from these messages. He almost insulted me, blocked me and blocked me on Couchsurfing too, letting me unable to leave a review about his behavior.

I’m glad I didn’t have to step a foot there, as I would have been so damn embarrassed to find a hotel at that time in Geneva; it was the Salon de l’Automobile (a car exposition) and all the hotels were full, that’s why I chose couchsurfing at first…

In the end, I found another guy on couchsurfing that was REALLY nice and we are still friends up to date :)

You must always trust your guts feeling about people and talk in advance with them.",
29,2,"It’s not totally safe in my opinion. I used it a lot over two years. There are many normal people and hosts. However, I bumped into a few too many strange hosts and guests. I wouldn’t recommend AirBnb.

The safest AirBnb’s were ones where I was largely isolated from the host and the other guests. However, those are also expensive rooms such that you might be better off with a hotel room anyways as the price advantage is lost.

I also feel threatened by hosts in many instances because of the double-reviewing systems when guests and hosts are reviewed alike. Your reputation is staked on the host’s interpretation of you, which can be completely flawed.

For example, once I had a host question me about pot smoking in my room. The truth was the scent originated outside of my room but entered through ventilation. I was very nervous that I would be described as a potsmoker in my review even though I abstain.

Also, I’ve felt that I was on a hidden camera in AirBnbs before. There were hosts that seemed to have an omniscient understanding of what I was doing that was revealed through statements made.

One host, for example, said that I threw a spoon across her kitchen. In reality, I had an injured foot from hiking but still had to cook for myself. I was very tender on the bottom of my feet so when I was done with a spoon, I leaned over and underhand-tossed the spoon into the kitchen sink to save a couple of painful footsteps. This sink was very close to where I was standing. Importantly, I was alone when I did this and no one saw me.

The host didn’t like me for reasons that aren’t clear. She left me a bad review that described how I threw her spoon across her kitchen and was disrespectful. It made me think about what transpired and there was no way that she was there to witness this spoon-gate fiasco in person. She must have been watching me on hidden camera and this was against the rules for the site which state that cameras must be in the house rules if they are to be used. You have to wonder how much of that is going on and you hear news about cameras in other areas if you know what I mean….

I don’t think I can use AirBnb in the future.",
30,3,"I am an Airbnb host and I have had the worst experiences lately hosting guest that LIE, LIE, LIE, LIE and tell more LIES on their review as a reactive response to not getting what they want or my revising household rules as outlined in the listing. I feel like its the worst time of dishonesty in the world. It is such a violation when you have open your personal living space to a human liar. I do not know about other locations but I have spent a substantial amount of money proactively to ensure that our guest have a quality stay.

One of my last guest(s) booked as a group of 4 and arrived as a group of 5 persons. The person who booked their reservation was not within the group. There are 3 bedrooms and shared living space as reflected in the listing. This group on their last day in the house, came into the property while other guest were asleep they started a huge argument second level on my property. There was yelling, cussing, crying complete out of control craziness! I received a call from another guest who had been awaken from their rest.

I came to the house and found one of the 5 sleeping on the main sofa in the house when sleeping arrangements are restricted to the bedroom areas. I kindly told the guest that I had plan to still give them a good review overall but it is important during their continued travels via Airbnb that they lower the voice volume out of respect for other travelers. They departed our location and upon coming to the end of my driveway it appears that they left one of the 5 stranded right their on the spot as there was division in the group. They were not getting along.

Once online I gave them a standard review with no negative undertones, I really focused on what they did well during the visit. I in turn received a feedback return that the room was overpriced at 70 dollars for 5 people! You do the math. Additionally, the review stated I was unprofessional as a Host. I am still beside myself about it. How am I unprofessional for asking a guest why I am receiving a call at 3 a.m. regarding yelling, cussing, crying and fighting in my home?

UNBELIEVE! If you are looking for negative reviews on Airbnb please look at what these people posted on my account. But here is an important note you should note in advance. ALL LIES and the worst thing is as a host there is noting you can do to remove support of this other person's manipulative deception.",
31,3,"Well, I only can say about my experience so far.

So far, I received 43 reviews and I also wrote 43. All the reviews are good because the guest really liked to stay in my house and I really liked them. Besides that, I also stayed in some places that I really liked and the owner really liked to host me. All my reviews I received and wrote I can guarantee that are real and good.

However, I also saw some ""competitors"" in my area that they had some bad reviews and they deleted this property and created a new one. However, the bad reviews can be seen on the ""user"" reviews. So, when the guest books the property, usually he checks the reviews for the property only. Thus, the ""bad"" reviews are not there, since the house is a ""new"" fresh start. However, the ""bad"" reviews can be seen under the user profile. But the guests usually do not check there, mainly because the new Airbnb users are not aware about that. All the reviews received for a particular user can be seen under his profile.

Airbnb can't do anything about that because they really can't. But the guest can. Before rent a place, check all the user's review. The guest should not be constrained to ask question to the host. the guest should also ask things about the procedures to check in/out, how is the cleaning, the real distance and time to the places of interest, etc.

Sometimes, I received a booking request even before any question or message. I think my reviews and my rank help and support me for that, but I do recommend the guests make some question to the owner first. I would suggest to the guest rely on the reviews and verifications, but also verify by themselves the host with some basic question, like:

 * How often the house is clean and deep clean?
 * How often the house receive a exterminator? Is for prevention only or you had some problem in the past?
 * How is the around? If I will open the windows, I will hear any noisy from outside?
 * How often the air condition is cleaned?
 *  How often the pool is cleaned? Who clean that?
 * How good is the internet? Is WiFi?
 * How it will work to use th phone? Can the geust used unlimited? And International calls?
 * Is the rental for the entire house, private room or shared room or it is a hotel room? (Yes, there are some hotels rooms being rented as entire house and double check).
 * Are the taxes included in the price?
 * Is there any other fee that I will have to pay? If the answer is no, the owner is lying because always there is a small fee from Airbnb to be paid by the guest. So, the owner is not experience enough or he is lying.
 * How is the cancellation procedure/policy? Always double check that.
 * If the owner asks for a ""security deposit"", double check the criteria for that.
 * Ask if the place allows pets or not. If you do not want to stay in a place where is allowed to host pets, ask that as if you will stay with pets. If the owner accept that with a payment of a fee, so, you can stay in a place that pets may be accepted.
 *  The same thing for smoking.
 * How is the parking?
 * Check in/out procedures.
 * Ask if some guest in the past had some problem, issue or even the security deposit claim in the past. If so, ask more information about that.

I hope I could help. As owner, I will be not ofended to answer those questions, because, I want to offer good memoried to the guests and I want to make them 100% sure about their decision.",
32,3,"YES AIRBNB DELETES NEGATIVE REVIEWS.

Airbnb deletes negative reviews so you will buy from them. Airbnb also pretends you are renting from an individual, when you are really renting from a large and growing number of property manager businesses. In Downtown Toronto, property manager Host Services Group rents over 200 properties on AirBnB and Booking.com. You may think you are communicating with the owner, however there is a very good chance you are looking at a facade, and behind the facade is a large property manager building a big business. Because it is big business, property managers like host services group will work very hard to ensure you DO NOT get any negative reviews about the quality of their rooms or service.

I am currently in an Apartment listed on Airbnb and booking.com. When I arrived, the bed sheets were not changed, they had been slept in and the kitchen was dirty.

No, my hair is not black and straight.

No I did not eat here, this was the first counter I encountered walking into the apartment.

What!?!? You were expecting clean sheets?!?

The next day, after sending these photos, the property manager Host Services Group sent over a “cleaning manager” who spent most of his time taking pics and texting. Then he told me they will send someone to clean on day 3 of my stay, fully expecting me to spend a second night using dirty sheets. After some prompting from me (give me a refund and I will clean, or get it done yourself) he reluctantly started cleaning. Got the kitchen to a passable state. Then did some laundry but I am not sure what he did, because when I went to bed, there was no top sheet and the top sheets bunched in the closet still had hair on and in them. So I sent photos to Host Services Group, they replied: ""My name is Brad and I'm the operations director for Host Services Group. At this point there is nothing further we can do for you regarding cleaning. We have used this housekeeping service for over a decade and they clean over 200 properties for us around the city. I honestly feel you're better off at a hotel where you can receive daily housekeeping to your liking. No further housekeeping will be provided. Brad Operation Manager Host Services Group.

So in other words: you are costing me too much in cleaning services and we don’t really care about customer service, but we are happy to keep your $1075.

The last apartment I booked in Toronto through AirBnB was this listing: Luxuriously appointed urban suite [ https://www.airbnb.ca/rooms/19866945 ]. I wrote a negative review because the owner left for Florida and I could not get in. I ended up spending 3 hours waiting in a nearby McDonalds to get into the apartment. He then made me contact them by email every time I needed to access the apartment because he had a wifi lock. This apartment has no window coverings, so you have floor to ceiling windows and either city light or day light in the bedroom at all times.

My negative review was removed from this apartment’s AirBnB listing, and I just noticed I cannot see any apartments in Toronto on the AirBnB App.

So if you write a negative review on AirBnB, they could also block you, because hey, AirBnB doesn’t like a sad face.",
33,3,"It seems like they do. Airbnb told me that the following review [approximate, this was my draft] was “not relevant” and deleted it - I think they either didn’t like the fact that I mentioned another website or that it was negative. These seemed like relevant facts to me relating to the host, the accessibility of amenities, the house and the general surroundings. Airbnb messages kept saying that I knew about the amenity fee in advance, but I didn’t know I’d need to drive 20 minutes RT to get it.

“Jimmy’s house was quite nice but I had a serious problem with making the reservation and the community is not as nice as I thought it would be. There is trash strewn around the community (not huge amounts but more than there should be) and not renter friendly. There are two lakes, but only one small lake beach 5 miles away open for swimming. Also, you either need to get a pass for the whole time you are there in advance for $5/person/day or drive 20 minutes round trip to get the daily pass, even if you want to go to the pool that is a 5-minute walk away. I went to Tobyhanna state park instead, which is free. There are a lot of deer on the property and they come in the yard which was special.

I had booked this property on another website weeks in advance with a different host who was managing the property. Two weeks before my reservation I was told I needed to cancel on that site and rebook on Airbnb, since Jimmy, the owner, was now managing the property directly. It was much more expensive on Airbnb. The communication around the change was poor. Eventually Jimmy agreed to rent at the original rate if I gave up the July 4th weekend. He thinks he did me a favor with this deal, but I think he should have honored my original reservation. Communication after the reservation was good.“",
34,3,"My partner and I have used airbnb for years both as hosts and as travellers across 4 continents. While we have loved many wonderful hosts and delighted in hosting guests, we have stopped using airbnbn in favour of Booking.com: 975,749 hotels worldwide. Book your hotel now! [ http://booking.com ] due to airbnb’s unethical management. You need to be aware that by using airbnb you're supporting a company who:

1. Has an arbitrary review process. We wrote a review of a nightmare host who had positive feedback. Our review didn’t appear, we had to manually check for it. We had to contact Airbnb to ask why they didn’t publish our review. Airbnb said that they ‘should’ have emailed us, and when it turned out airbnb failed to email us, airbnb investigated why our review wasn’t published. i.e. their staff were clueless, no notes were available on our account. Turns out the host had objected, and Airbnb had published her review on us, but not ours on her due to a technicality (we pasted a text message our host had sent us). We were happy to revise our review by simply removing the pasted phrase. Airbnb wouldn’t allow this. I don’t know of any serious site that conducts such a one-sided arbitrary (and faulty) review process. This was highly likely the reason this nightmare hosts’ feedback didn’t feature anything negative – she usese airbnb’s arbitrary feedback process to block reviews. So you can’t trust reviews on Airbnb.

2. See nothing wrong with renting out properties that have been stolen. Yes, you read that right: stolen. Check out the campaign on sumofus and other sites. Airbnb will rent you property that by international UN law has been stolen in Palestine. Many have written, handed in petitions (over 150k signatories to date) and used other methods to get Airbnb to cease their unethical and illegal practice, to no avail.",
35,3,"Airbnb are hiding and doctoring reviews ... My ecperience!

I had a first time experience with airbnb.

Although largely the experience was fine and my review was a long detailed one much the sane as posted on TripAdvisor in past.

I see the whole point of these experiences is to share the good and bad.  

Everything about my hosts mother who took care of us n was in flat  and the flat was great. Except for the host ... She basically had taken payment for breakfast and then said she hadn't. I did the calc to prove it was paid. Her mother was fine and provided it no issues. So I said in the review this was sorted.

But in my review I also had a v negative review of airbnb for not making charges for admin service and card/PayPal conversion fees obvious and transparent.  I also said I'd be complaining to them as the host said they never received the extra money I'd paid airbnb for the breakfast. 

So air bnb is pocketing extra cash.

I told her to also complain.

The next thing you know my post doesn't get posted and there is only one line posted of 4words which is only the title I gave the review! The 4 words were positive and a 4 star rating. 

Although I would use again airbnb are cheating consumers and hosts in monies earned and in terms of describing actual experience. Thus you could end up staying somewhere which is  rubbish    but as airbnb doctors the posts or hides them u wouldn't know any different!

Responses from airbnb are ... ""Maybe you hit post too soon"" or ""you forgot what you posted"" nonsense like that. Or ""you had internet issues""

Absolute nonsense.

They are doctoring things for sure.

Be suspect of any short reviews and any place that has no negative or balanced comments.

What is the point of reviews if they are edited/hidden! 

I'll tell you what ... More money in air bnb coffers!

TripAdvisor/trust pilot/other review sites ... - please open up the ability for users to add airbnb hosts and apartments to trip advisor.so they can be independently reviewed!

A disgusted airbnb member!!!",
36,3,"According to their website, reviews cannot be removed (including negative ones) [1]:


%3E Unfortunately, reviews cannot be removed. The promise of our site is that it is entirely transparent and that both hosts and guests can post reviews of their experiences. A review is very much a personal opinion, and therefore can be significantly different for each stay. Travelers take this into account when booking and reading the posted reviews, so you should not feel overly concerned with one negative review. Just make sure your next reservation is successful. Take note of the feedback, improve the experience, and host again.

As someone who has hosted 15+ guests and stayed as a guest once, I've never left nor received a negative review. Furthermore, I've seen very few negative reviews. I'd guess the lack of negative reviews are due to three possible factors:
1. They could leave you a negative review (less likely) -- Since guests and hosts can see the reviews that are posted about them, a user who has been negatively-reviewed by someone else could, in theory, leave a negative review for the other user, out of spite.
2. It's awkward to leave a negative review (somewhat likely) -- You most likely interacted with the guest/host for at least 15 minutes and feel some connection. Also, as a guest, there's a feeling of ""this person let me into their home and sleep there.""
3. Almost all Airbnb experiences are extremely positive (most likely) -- My girlfriend, Emily Glick [ https://www.quora.com/profile/Emily-Glick ], and I have had only positive experiences using Airbnb, both as hosts and guests. Sure, we've had a less outgoing guests (very few), but everyone has been extremely respectful of us, our space, and our apartment/stuff. We've never left a negative review for a guest/host for this reason and this reason alone.

37,3,"Postscript first.

AirBnb requires hosts to maintain an average of 4.3 stars to stay on the platform. This means that there are actually only 3 rating choices.

5 is good - 4 or less is “delist this dump” - No review at all is the only neutral choice. 
So obviously hosts are going to try pretty hard to avoid 4 stars or less, one way or the other.

Even more obviously, if AirBnb delists any properties with average ratings less than 4.3 stars, you’re not going to see those low ratings. That is presumably the idea, to ensure quality.

Apparently the 4.3 star requirement applies only to the “overall” rating, it doesn’t take the subratings like “accuracy” or “cleanliness” into account. So a guest does have some leeway to give lower ratings on the subcategories with a 5 overall to “do no harm”.

Original answer:

The answer by Eric Mathiesen hits the nail on the head. He points out that as long as a host doesn’t just neglect the guest, and tries to make a good faith effort, most guests don’t feel like returning the favor with a slap and a bad review.

Also consider that neither host nor guest have anything to gain from posting a negative review, unless they are really ticked off they can get that off their chest. The other thing is that there are usually extenuating circumstances for shortcomings, so even if it was not ideal, you got a deal and you don’t want to hurt the other guy, you’d rather just move on. 
A negative review when a host is just starting out can be extremely damaging, so hosts do usually make an effort to please, and this is usually rewarded.

It is extremely difficult to get AirBnb to remove a bad review. There are some answers here bashing AirBnb which may be based on misunderstandings, with claims that don’t tally with the reality I’m familiar with.

On the whole, the review process really does work like AirBnb says it does. For instance, you have to post a review within 14 days after the stay, and you can’t see the other side’s review until you post yours, or if you don’t post a review, then until the 14 days are up. You also can’t edit reviews. You can’t wait and respond in kind. This is so hosts and guests can’t bargain or extort for reviews.

You can say, it was a good experience, I’m giving you a good review, and I hope you give me one too. But you have no leverage to make them give you a good review.

As for AirBnb hiding negative reviews, they show in the order newest first, so you’d have to search for a bad one that’s a year old.

Open source reviews have done a lot to make it possible for the Internet to provide goods and services. It was a genius idea to harness everybody’s two cents’ worth into building a billion dollar company! But consumers and small vendors also benefit. So all around it is a win-win.

The answer by Jose Roberto Barros is also excellent and informative, explaining how he has given and received only positive reviews, along with some other good advice.",
38,3,"Airbnb in general is very unustworthy with reviews. i'd like to point out two things:- 
1. That they dont mention dates on the reviews and only have an arbitrary month at the top implying that the reviews are recent though they are not. 
2. They blend reviews of other properties around the property with reviews of the proper. I realized when I was reading reviews for a yacht and they seemed to be very out of context - ended up that they were for apartments in the same city.

In general, I feel airbnb as a company exaggerates and tries to sugar coat the risks of a typical transaction - case in point being their photographs of properties- they are uniformly shot very aesthetically but in order to make the property seem larger and more glamorous than it is - if airbnb was a proeprty owner on vrbo- a website that actually does a significantly better - they would have had the community chastize them for misleading potential customers by purting up such photos. With Airbnb, we now have a large number of owners who actually think travelers are best served by showing them portfolio shots - a good analogy - if you were on a dating website, would you prefer the other side to put up realistic photos or airbrushed, photoshopped ones?

Addition: I find the culture Airbnb (product) [ https://www.quora.com/topic/Airbnb-product ] interesting where there is a tendency to put ""marketing speak"" above being clear, straightforward and transparent. A good example - their newly launched 1mn USD insurance - I just read this - http://www.tnooz.com/2012/05/29/news/homeaway-thinks-1m-airbnb-host-guarantee-is-as-empty-as-a-vacant-apartment/ - It's obviously motivated coming from homeaway but makes it clear that there is likely no insurance here.",
39,3,"AirBnB hides negative reviews systematically. It does this 2 ways:

1. By hiding negative reviews that are inputted: I typed up a negative review on AirBnB and saved it. The host got mad at me because i got mad at him so he left me a bad review too. 1 year later I went to check in on the review on his page. I found that while it still exists in their database (it has an ID, i can see it in my history), it no longer appears on the page listing. If I click on the review to see it’s details, the details don’t even show up!
2. By not permitting people to leave reviews who have had cancellations: I once was not able to stay at an AirBnB because on arrival, I saw that the accommodation was completely different than advertised. Despite the negative experience, AirBnB wouldn’t let me write a review because they claimed that we didn’t stay there. In effect, they are only allowing people who complete their whole stay in a location to leave reviews.
AirBnB has a conflict of interest in providing transparency on property/host reviews. If guests see that there are negative reviews for a property, they are much less likely to stay, and AirBnB will not make their commission on that property going forward.

It’s in their best interest to hide negative review of properties and hosts -%3E hence with they do it systematically.",
40,4,"Reading through the previous answers here, it all seem like the same regurgitated answers on personal finance sites anyone interested in the question has already read.  Here are some things that will save you actual money:

1. Instead of trying to pinch pennies out of groceries, sundries, etc, save money on big ticket items.  I'm talking about learning how and when to buy as house.  When interest rates are low, buy.  2008-2012 was the best time to buy if you could do it.  Still pretty good now, but not the best.  Negotiate, and to the bitter end.  $10,000 up front is thousands more in interest. Learn how to buy a car used, and never lease.  Shop around on appliances & electronics.
2. Don't waste time on shopping around on small items. Your time is better served earning money or being productive than saving $5 each trip to the grocery store.  Pick a store that has good prices (costco, amazon, wal-mart) and shop there without worry.
3. Instead of an emergency savings account fund, start a Fund.  Something liquid if you need it, but can earn some money.  You aren't going to lose it all if the market crashes.  And to that point, if the market crashes, BUY!  Index funds, mutual funds, stocks, etc.
4. Learn how to fix and maintain your big ticket items.  Electricity and plumbing are age-old items, yet no one is getting rid of them anytime soon.  And yet there is very little interest by today's Millennials on how they work or how to fix them.  Not to mention ever becoming a tradesman.  This trick alone will save you thousands or earn you (hundreds?) of thousands.  Learn how to change the oil in your car.  It takes 2 tools and literally 15 minutes. You know the job is done right and with quality oil.  

5. Take all your time saved by not clipping coupons, and earn more money.  It doesn't matter if you want to become an entrepreneur or just move up in corporate business.  But take the time to further your skills either way.

The trick to buying relatively cheaper flight tickets and here it goes:

Starting with what to avoid : Don't buy tickets on a Saturday!

The reason why plane tickets are the highest on Saturdays is because airlines follow a weekly pricing system that can seem confusing and frustrating to travelers. 

The Pricing System:

It started way back when airlines ran promotions in newspapers and people actually went to travel agencies, which were open during business hours Monday through Friday. Even though most people book their flights online now, this weekly system still works to score flight deals.

Back before the internet, pricing executives would look at the available flights for the week on Monday to determine whether they should offer a sale. If there were too many unsold seats at the beginning of the week, a sale was held to encourage travelers to buy.

So the best time to buy tickets:

Airlines still offer their sales at the beginning of the week, starting on Monday. Just like they used to to clear out unsold seats after the weekend when sales are slowest, airlines begin offering their sales at the beginning of the week.

But by Tuesday, something amazing happens-

Competing airlines price match each others’ sales, engaging a a full-blown price war to get customers to take their deal.

This means that Tuesday is the best day to score an unbelievable deal. If you want to get even more specific, a study found that Tuesday at 3 p.m. (EST) was when flights were at their lowest price for the whole week.

Savings?

The average price of a flight sold on a Saturday was 7% higher than the average price of a flight sold on a Friday. It definitely pays to book your flight during the week (even Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays had cheaper flights compared to weekends).

For example it is a long time since we went backwards in Australia . The Chinese kindly brought anything we could dig up and put on a ship but those days are gone. We are now just renovating our homes and selling them to each other. It has become some kind of new national sport.

The housing market is a growing pool of money but we borrowed it mostly. 

If you are getting low and risky interest is it worth keeping our money outside of the banks for a while as the quantitative easing and monetary policy plays out around the world  

Currency that are used to trade a lot are called reserve currencies they are great for paying your bills internationally. However they are all being governed heavily bythe reserve banks of their respective countries 

Your savings take a long time to accumulate by the time you live the ratio of what you save to what comes in your bank that nest egg may be the result of many years work.

45,4,"I'll step outside the box you were probably thinking of and offer you some food for thought.

If you work in the US, the single most impactful piece of advice I can offer you is to enroll in your company's 401K plan.  If they don't have one, then open a Roth IRA.  As your income increases over the years, keep upping the percentage until you've hit the maximum you can contribute.  Many companies offer to match a certain percentage of your contribution, sometimes up to 100%.  This is free money, I repeat, free money.  You'd be a fool not to accept their gracious offer.

Here is the theory that all too many people do not see (or choose not to see).

You cannot spend what you do not have.

401K contributions are a forced savings with pretax dollars.  That makes a huge difference.  Instead of putting 60 to 70 after tax dollars into an investment (which you could easily take out), that exact same money would be represent 100 pre tax dollars that you cannot touch [1].  Combine that with your employer's contribution of $100, and you get $200.  Let that compound over the next 20, 30 or 40 years and you'll be pleasantly surprised that $60 net take home pay that you would have blown on a nice dinner is now worth thousands in your golden years.  Do it week after week, year after year for the remainder of your working career and you'll be living very comfortably in your retirement years, while your paycheck-to-paycheck living colleagues are scraping by on food stamps and social security [which could be completely broken by the time you're old and grey].

All this takes sacrifice, though.  No pain, no gain, as they like to say at the gym.

Maybe you're a twenty-something and thinking, but ""I'm young and single and love to mingle.""  I need cash to do that.  Sure, by all means, go out and have fun, but don't blow it all.  Save a little.  Start small if you're earn a modest paycheck.  Once you start making the big bucks, ramp it up full steam (i.e. put all your disposable income that you can manage).

Scenario 1: You bought property for 20 lacs in 2005 and sold it for 100 lacs in 2012. You made a 400% profit in the rallying property market. Around 26% p.a. . Great !!

Scenario 2: You bought a property for 20 lacs. You paid 20% i.e. 4 lacs out of your pocket and 80% i.e. 16 lacs financed by a bank. Suppose you are paying only interest component at 10% p.a. and returned the full principal at the end of 7 years in 2012. You paid an yearly amount of 1.6 lacs and 16 lacs in 2012 for ending the loan. Total amount paid by you = 1.6x 7 = 11.2 + 16 = 27.2 .

Save the butter wrapper to grease cookie sheets/cake pans with

use rags and towels instead of paper towels

Line dry your clothes

Cut the cable bill and get Netflix or Amazon prime, or rent movies for free from your local library

Plant a vegetable garden, or even just a small herb garden

Buy secondhand - clothing, furniture, household items

Learn to cut your own hair, or even just to do your own trim and get proper haircuts every other time

Trade talents with friends - perhaps you are great at sewing and your neighbor is a baker, save them a visit to the tailor and maybe they'll bring you fresh bread.

Buy a French press for your coffee - better coffee, no electricity, no coffee machine hogging kitchen space, no buying filters

Don't buy things like boxed cake mix or bisquick - keep staples on hand like flour, sugar, baking powder - and make these types of things from scratch. Same goes for gravy, taco seasoning, all those things that come in little packets are easily made from scratch. Cheaper, better for you. Also, makes you more versitile in the kitchen.

If you've got a baby, consider cloth diapers and wipes. My son is almost a year old, I've never bought baby wipes, and while we use pampers on occasion, it takes me about two months to get through one a box. My initial investment was around $200.

Learn some skills - basic plumbing, carpentry, anything that keeps you from having to call in a profesional. At the same time, know the limits of your abilities, so you don't end up costing yourself more in the long run.

AirBNB is making a lot of revenue… a hell lot of revenue….. they are having crazy growth, it is the 2nd most valuable Startup of USA after Uber.

Do you really want to see their revenues? Let me warn you, it will be very difficult to digest and process the information you see over here.

The current worth of AirBNB a 10 year old start-up is more than the combined worth two of the most popular hospitality business founded over fifty years ago, Hyatt and Accor… Ooh buoy.. you got to feel for them.

Do you still wish to see the stats?

Here you go…

Now someone might ask, the graph is not looking too steep, but read the figures dude, it is growing at a crazy pace and that too very consistently, they have maintained the growth rate between 150 - 300% over the years

One More Fun Fact:

After completing the first year of AirBread & Breakfast they made less than $10000 a year and in after 9 years in the year 2017 they made revenue of over $2.6 billion…

One More Shocking Graph

AirBNB has almost completed 10 years, and we have data of growth of nine years so let’s compare the growth of first 5 years and last four years, here you will be able to see that crazy steep showing their crazy growth

Growth in the last 4 years is almost 1000% isn’t it crazy…

It is not like only AirBNB is growing, the travel and hospitality industry is seeing a paradigm shift people are preferring these vacation rental and renting a place rather than booking a traditional hotel room.

This has opened lot of different opportunities to for new players enter the space with some innovativeness and establish their strong feet in this rapidly growing space.

50,5,"Based on the stats they just released, we can reasonably estimate their 2010 revenue is in the $5 million - $15 million range, and probably in the high single-digit millions.

They reported to TechCrunch that they have booked 800k total nights (http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/06/airbnb-2010/), the vast majority of which were in 2010.

AirBnB gets revenue from renters via a 6%-12% markup on the listing price, as well as from listers via a 3% commission on the listing price (http://www.airbnb.com/help/topic/hosting). So if someone lists a room for $100, AirBnB charges $106-$112 to the buyer, pays $97 to the lister, and collects $9-$15 ($3 in listing commission and $6-$12 in buyer markup).

Most rooms on the site appear to be in the $50-$100 range. If we generously take the high end and assume the average room is listed by sellers at $100, and use an average listing markup of 9%, their estimated revenue is:

800k nights * $100 per night * (9% markup + 3% commission) = $9,600,000 in total revenue

Of course, if the average listing is for $50, revenue is $4.8 million. If the average listing or average commission is higher, then revenue could be quite a bit higher. 
With the same assumptions used above (800k nights, $100 average, 9% fee), the company has $87,200,00 in gross bookings per year, and I suspect that this figure is the reason that rumors of insanely high revenue have been floating around.",
51,5,"Short answer:
Estimate of $3.5-$10M in 2010, and much more in 2011.

Long answer for how to guesstimate via the following:
 * Airbnb has booked 1M nights so far, and what looks like ~700k in 2010 [1]
 * It's hard to figure out what the average price per night is, but let's guess that it's somewhere between $50-$100 per night based on browsing the site
 * Airbnb takes 3% from the host and 6-12% from the guest [2]

With these rough parameters, you can make the following conclusions:

 * A low range would be 700k nights at 10% transaction with $50/night. That leads to ~$3.5M of revenue in 2010 on $35M in GMS.
 * A high estimate would be 700k nights at 15% with $100/night. That leads to ~$10.5M revenue on $70M GMS.

Based on well-sourced data re: airbnb's valuation in their Series A, I would guess that it's closer to the lower number in the range rather than %3E$10M.

The important part of that the runrate now is probably pretty great now. The # of nights booked looks slightly better than linear in the infographic, and the first half of 2010 was slow, so you could imagine that the 2011 number is going to be significantly higher than 2010.

Let's say $20M in 2011?

52,5,"The questions and relative answers seems a bit outdated, but I'll try to briefly sum up the most recent situation.

The latest numbers

The latest available revenue numbers are from November 2015, coming from an investor presentation that circulated before the last $100M funding round. [1] 

In the third quarter of 2015, Airbnb generated:

 * 23.8 million nights booked (around 5 million bookings, given a 5 nights average stay)
 * $2.2 billion in bookings values (price paid by guests)
 * $340 million in revenue (fees for the company)
These values are roughly double if compared to 2014 figures, and the company is reportedly ahead of the estimates set for 2015, projecting around $900 million revenue by the end of the year.



How does Airbnb make money?

Airbnb  charges a fee to both hosts and guests for each reservation happening through its platform.

 * Guests are charged between 6 and 12%
 * Hosts are charged 3%
 * Based on the revenue and booking numbers, the average fee is 15.5% of the price paid by guests
Despite the impressive numbers, Airbnb is still a company focused on growth (not on profitability). As such, in 2015 it will still deal with operational expenses that are yet covered by the revenues, reportedly ending the fiscal year with an operative loss of around $150 million.

The company has recently been testing a 4-5 x increase to the fees charged to hosts [ http://all-about-airbnb.com/post/127174229801/airbnb-hidden-revenue-hack-extra-host-fees-google-ads?utm_source=quora&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=google_ads_fees ] for new bookings coming through paid marketing, and this might help the company to reach profitability at an earlier stage.



How much are these numbers expected to grow?

The trajectory of the company seems pretty healthy, especially since there are still massive opportunities ahead (in particular: business travel, Asian market, vacation rentals).

However, Airbnb is not necessarily pushing a strategy to maximize revenues, rather looking at nights booked as the main KPI to focus on.



What can affect negatively Airbnb's revenues?

The company's growth has been under the radar for many local regulators, and given the current trajectory, many big cities around the world have started a process to get a  part of the cake through local taxation (similar to what is already imposed to the hotel industry).

Furthermore, as more than 70% of the bookings are occurring outside of the US, fluctuations on the exchange rates might affect both the amount of bookings and their value.

So between $12M and $36M a year currently.

Now let's say that by December 2011 they are booking 1M nights per month. That would be between $5M and $15M per month in revenue.

That's an annual rate of $60M to $180M.",
57,5,"They’re set to earning $1B in revenue in 2019. How much of it is earned from fake listings, we don’t know.

We do know that a significant and growing percentage of Airbnb’s revenue is driven by commercial operators, not by locals who rent out a spare room in their home . This is a a major problem because commercial operators are the ones behind fake listings, allow parties, cancel bookings, (because they list on multiple platforms outside of AirBnb and take the highest bidder) and take away rental stock from locals.

Commercial operators often buy up multiple residential properties to rent them out on a full-time basis, just like a hotel. They make a ton of money at the misery of the locals who live on the neighboring properties.",
58,5,"They just published an infographic on their global growth - http://www.airbnb.com/global-growth

Between Jan 2011 and Jan 2012 they booked 4m room nights. Assuming an average of $100 per night and 15% Airbnb stake (12% + 3%):

5m nights * $100 per night * 15% Airbnb Fee = $75,000,000 in total net revenue (that is, after they have remitted the room charge back to the property owners)
Obviously this number changes with lower/higher variables above (avg room nights and airbnb fee).",
59,6,"Let's grab some data. I sadly don't have access to Airbnb's web logs, so I ran a few user research and human evaluation studies instead.

My goal was to answer the following questions:
1. You can't book a great place if you can't find one. So how good is Airbnb's search ranking algorithm? What are its problems (are listings returned on the high end of the price filters? are too many poorly reviewed listings being shown?), and how can we fix them?
2. A big chunk of Amazon purchases comes from its related book algorithms. So how well does Airbnb's Similar Listings model perform? Does it showcase great substitute properties, or is it displaying irrelevant suggestions?
3. Airbnb probably wants (and needs) to evolve. Where do users find the current booking experience difficult and confusing, and what kinds of new products and changes would help improve it?
4. Different people use Airbnb differently. What are the archetypical patterns of travel, and is it worth improving their experience in different ways?
5. Hotels are Airbnb's major competitor. So when do users still prefer staying in a hotel and why?
I'll give an overview of what I found below, and I threw up a more detailed report here: Product Insights for Airbnb [ https://speakerdeck.com/edwinchen/product-insights-for-airbnb ].




Quality of Airbnb Search


Let's start with Airbnb Search. In order to measure the quality of their algorithms, I asked 100 evaluators to think about a trip they wanted to take in the next year, to search for a place to stay on Airbnb, and to rank the quality of the results.

For example, one of my evaluators described a trip she wanted to take with her husband and kids to Disneyland:

“We love going to Disneyland and would like to go back sometime this year around the beginning of the summer. Ideally we would go for a week but it depends on price. I would want to go with my husband and kids because it's a really fun and special experience for all of us.”

She then searched for places to stay on Airbnb:


And this is how she rated the first search result.


“Fairly bad result. It looks like a nice play to stay but I don't like that it's actually part of another house. I would want to feel like we have total privacy instead of sharing certain areas. There are also an awful lot of rules about when and what you can do. I understand to an extent but seeing it all written out comes across as kind of negative.  It's also not really that close to Disneyland.”

Even from just this one example, we can see a few problems and potential improvements to the search algorithm:
1. Where exactly is Disneyland, and why are listings so far away from Anaheim shown? If we look at the map of search results, it's impossible to tell how close each listing is to Anaheim's main attraction. Given that most travel is around landmarks in new and unfamiliar locations, how much quicker would the search and booking process be if it was easy for users to figure out where attractions were located?
2. People like to use Airbnb as a home away from home, and strict rules detract from this experience. Is it worth adding features to the ranking algorithm that measure how home-like a listing may be?
3. Staying in an RV may be fairly private, but it's not the same as getting the place to yourself. Should RVs and other such listing types be penalized in searches for an entire property?
For more feedback, check out the deck, and here's the numeric summary. Around 2/3 of search results were judged good, and 1/3 were pretty bad.


Search results lower on the page are worse (so the ranker does indeed seem to be pulling out a signal).

And these were the main problems users found.

For example, the top three issues were:
 * Too expensive. Sometimes search results are on the high end of price range filters (though worth it), and other times they're simply overpriced for what you get. Airbnb already has a price prediction algorithm; would it be worth using it to differentiate between the two?
 * Unappealing style. Listings often don't have the style users are looking for. A listing, for example, might not be hip and modern enough, or a male user might encounter listings with pink wallpaper and flowery decorations.
 * Bad location. Results are often too far away from tourist attractions (e.g., listings 30 minutes away from the Las Vegas Strip), or in bad neighborhoods.
(Note: this sample of raters is, of course, not necessarily representative of Airbnb's actual user base. But I think the problems they highlight are interesting and useful to understand anyways.)




Performance of Similar Listings

I ran a similar analysis of Airbnb's Similar Listings. Overall numbers are similar to those in Search: roughly 2/3 of Similar Listings are good results, and 1/3 are bad.


One big new problem that showed up on Similar Listings, though, was the problem of inconsistent listing types. For example, users often found great search results where they would get the entire home to themselves, but all the Similar Listings displayed would be for shared, communal properties (which they wouldn't want to book).




Deterrents to Booking


What blockers prevented raters from wanting to book a place, and what information would have made the search and booking process much smoother?

1. One blocker was neighborhood discovery. Travelers often don't know much about where they're traveling, so it's unclear which neighborhoods are convenient, or whether a great-looking listing is actually in a safe location.

For example, here's what one rater traveling to Belfast wrote.

“It looks great, and I'd definitely want to contact the host so long as I do some research and remain as enthusiastic. The price is reasonable and the apartment looks great. The main thing I would want to check is the area it's in, Lisburn.  I don't know how convenient that is compared to the rest of Belfast and the Titanic quarter. If it was convenient, I would probably go for this.”

Could Airbnb provide more information about neighborhoods within their site, or better guide users to where they'd want to stay?

2. One feature that would have helped ease worries about listings, or which would have made listings look even better (or appropriately worse), was Helpful Reviews.

Reviews on Airbnb are currently chronologically sorted, which means feedback like the following might be all you see on the first page.

But reviews are a key part of the decision-making process. Sites like Amazon and Yelp highlight their most helpful user reviews, and 80% of users say they like to read book reviews before making a purchase. (And since traveling is usually a much more expensive and extensively researched decision, reviews are probably even more important here.)


Uncensored user feedback is helpful for understanding location, host friendliness, cleanliness, and more. How much less worried would users be about booking a place, if they better understood what other travelers liked and disliked about it?





A New Kind of Search


Let's look forward a bit. Google is continually evolving its search experience, from letting you search for images (and even reverse image search), to incorporating videos and news stories into search pages themselves, to improving the types of queries it understands.

So what could the future of Airbnb search look like?

One issue with its current state is that while it might be pretty good if you know exactly where you want to stay, it's less useful if you don't. (This ties back to the issue of neighborhood discovery.)

For example, one of my raters wanted to book a skiing trip in Wisconsin with his wife.

“Within the next 2 months, I'd like to go to the northern part of my state (WI) to a skiing resort.  I want to go for the weekend with my husband.  I want to do this because we need a getaway and it would be romantic and we would still have plenty to do.”


So he added a skiing keyword to his search, and what did he get? Completely useless results.

This, for instance, was the first listing:


“Horrible result. The room is not ideal, it’s not romantic at all.  The location is unappealing, it is near an urban area and there is no mention of skiing.  I'm looking for a place near a skiing area, I don't have a specific location, because I don't know where they are, just that we have them.  The price is okay, it's just not what I want at all.”

The rest of the listings were similarly unrelated to skiing.

If we inspect the results, we see that the reason they're returned is poor keyword matching: the word skiing appears in the description of the host (she likes to go skiing), but not in the description of the listing itself.


This problem may be fixable (we can try to machine learn which keywords should be matched where), but the question is a more general one: is it worth designing a better experience around general activity and travel search, instead of the main context being mere location?

After all, if Airbnb can make finding places to travel to easier, thereby encouraging more travel, or if it can convince users to spend their entire travel planning process on Airbnb, that could be another strong driver of growth.




Advantages of Hotels


Another path to more bookings is, of course, to increasingly convince travelers that Airbnb is a better option than staying in a hotel.

So what are the main advantages of the hotel experience right now?


1. 65% of the users mentioned that Airbnb had quality control problems. Hotels are a trusted brand that provide a consistent and guaranteed level of service (you know what you're getting into), whereas the quality of Airbnb listings can be uncertain and erratic. Your host may be unfriendly or unresponsive, the listing may be dirtier than advertised, the pictures might not be representative (or there might not be enough), and so on. (Promoting helpful reviews might be one way to help solve this problem.)
2. 45% mentioned that booking listings on Airbnb can be a hassle, especially at the last minute. There's a long and annoying process where you have to interact with the host, your host might cancel on you at the last minute, you often have to contact multiple hosts in order to see who will respond, and it's not even clear that a listing will be available. In contrast, hotels are a one-click process. (While Airbnb does have an Instant Booking feature with select listings, many users didn't seem to understand it or realize it existed.)
3. 30% mentioned the awkwardness of the forced human interaction. It can be stressful and tiring to wait for a host to let you in when you arrive, the communication process during booking is again an annoyance, and users also worry about disturbing owners too much with their asks and complaints. Companies like Uber grew in large part by removing the annoying part of human interaction (calling a taxi), and making the rest (chatting with your driver) optional. Should Airbnb do the same?
4. 25% just liked the amenities of a hotel (free breakfasts, gyms, spas, room service, and so on).




Traveler Archetypes


Finally, let's take a look at typical patterns of travel.

People travel for different reasons. Some vacations are centered around discovering new places, some are for romantic honeymoon getaways, and others are just to visit family during the holidays.

People also travel in different kinds of groups. Families may enjoy Airbnb more because of the cooking options and the possibility of having rooms separate from their sleeping, early-to-bed children. Coworkers traveling together may enjoy it less because it's harder to stay near each other (and because of potential expense difficulties).

So what are the clusters of traveler types, and how big are they? I ran a few Google Consumer Surveys, and here are the results.



Can Airbnb design different experiences around these groups, and see if they use the site in different ways?



And that's it. For people interested in more details, there's more information in the deck here: Product Insights for Airbnb [ https://speakerdeck.com/edwinchen/product-insights-for-airbnb ].",
60,6,"1. Allow users to better self-report/categorize their support messages. Currently, you are only given an option to specify whether your issue is urgent and requires immediate attention or not.
2. Add the ability to do advanced pricing by certain days of the weeks (i.e. weekend vs weekday rates).
3. Create a better experience for couples by (a) Allow two users with separate accounts become a couple on Airbnb and make a joint account, or (b) Allow two people to create a 'couple' account, or (c) Allow one account to have two email addresses that all communications get sent to (e.g. reservation requests, messages, standby alerts, etc.).
4. Allow hosts to require certain criteria for a guest to submit a reservation request (e.g. Facebook account connected to Airbnb profile, picture included, description posted, a certain number of reviews, etc.).
5. When an already signed-in user goes to Airbnb.com, default the view to the Dashboard, or at least create an option for this in settings.
6. Put a ""Your Listings"" link in the top link bar to quickly view all of your listings (not just the calendars) and/or each individual listings. I favorited my own listings just to quickly access them from the homepage.
7. Do away with the sideways-scrolling calendar functionality for users with multiple listings. The calendar UI is better, so at least figure out a way to overlay two listings onto one calendar or show multiple calendars on one page (side-by-side or one on top of the other).
8. Give users the ability to set time perimeters around the pricing of listings. For example, my listing regularly goes for $65/night, but perhaps if I always want it filled, I'm willing to drop it to $60 4 days before the applicable day, $55 3 days before, and so on. You could allow users to add time-based pricing models so as to ensure minimal management of listings with maximum return and success in filling listings.
9. For different types of listings for the same unit, allow users to create dynamic listings for multiple setups for the same listing. For example, I have two listings, a 'shared room' listing and a 'entire apt' listing for the same exact unit. I should be able to have just one listing that gives both options, either to rent out the entire apt or just the shared room.

Alternatively, allow hosts to make two listings for the same residence dependent on one other. For example, I have two listings, a 'shared room' listing and a 'entire apt' listing. When the entire apt listing is booked for 4/5 - 4/9, I should be able to set the system to know that the shared room will automatically become unavailable.
10. Post standbys for certain areas (e.g. cities, neighborhoods, etc.) to Twitter in addition to the website and emails. For example, if someone is looking for a place to stay in San Francisco, there should be a @AirbnbStandbysSF account that tweets out their standby alert. Quora does this really well with Quora's Official Twitter Accounts [ https://www.quora.com/topic/Quoras-Official-Twitter-Accounts ].
11. Create an Android App [ https://www.quora.com/topic/Android-Applications ]!
12. Provide more analytics on 'All page views'. Either by providing more static data or allowing the user to delve into the anonymized data to see who they are attracting to their listings and where (or for what price) people booked instead.
13. Provide more details on tax information for hosts who make more than $__ a year from Airbnb ($__ representing the point at which hosts need to start paying taxes on their revenues).
14. Make profiles a little more polished and complete. The current UI makes the profiles of people with no reviews look baron, even if they provide tons of info in their profile.
15. Having users ask to stay places with no picture or profile info seems really broken to me...either incentivize people to complete their profile (gaming dynamics?) or force them to do it. Maybe require Facebook Login [ https://www.quora.com/topic/Facebook-Login-4 ] or Login with Twitter?
16. Allow new users to authenticate with their Google account.
17. Portrait photos look ugly in the photo viewer for a listing. Either encourage users not to use portrait shots or make the area around portraits blend in more.
18. Fill the 'Account' page in with something more than just referral links and widgets. Alternatively, you could merge other tabs into the Account tab to fill it out more.
19. It would be great to have the option to stay in the loop on a feature request. Perhaps you could host your feature requests on something like GetSatisfaction [ https://www.quora.com/topic/Get-Satisfaction-company ], that way users could see popular FRs and when they were closed out (either added or seen as not useful at this time). Alternatively, you could use Quora for FRs.
20. Use auto-saving for forms and fields so as to not have users lose their work or messages while writing them (Quora (product) [ https://www.quora.com/topic/Quora-product ]-style).
21. Make the 'Reservation Request' email more dynamic, attractive, and detailed. For example, allow guests to accept/decline the reservation from the email itself with one-click.
22. Allow users to upload multiple pictures to their profile, and then select their main profile picture. Currently, you are only able to upload one picture and it is set as your primary picture, by default.
23. Make all text fields bigger or more dynamic so that they expand as you type. Currently, many of them are too small and so you must resize them as you type or scroll up and down repeatedly. For example, the Support/Contact Us ""Message"" text field can only fit four lines of text as shown below:

61,6,"I'm a heavy Airbnb user. I probably live in an Airbnb 6 or 7 months out of the year. Right now I'm in one. For the next four months I will be in three or four or five different Airbnbs. 

Not because of a work lifestyle. But because I love it. I love to explore and be in different places and most of all, I hate owning furniture, I don't like to rent, and I don't like to own. I like to be homeless through Airbnb.

So I don't know if that makes me qualified or not to answer this. Plus my wife does most of the booking so maybe all of these things are already satisfied. 

But here is my list: 

A) Airbnb Tonight:  I'm in a city, need a place to stay, I should be able to click on ""Airbnb Tonight"" and BAM! get my room. 

B) Consistent check-in and check-out. Check-out is by 11:30, check-in is at 4 pm or after. This is always an extra five emails of negotiation once you have a place booked. Making this a consistent policy shouldn't be hard. 

C) Airbnb Car: I pay an extra fee and the service gets my rental car (or Zipcar), takes care of picking me up at airport, etc. 

D) Review Checklist: instead of straight reviews, put in more uniform checklists: level of noise in area, cleanliness, hot water, TV works, Wi-Fi works, etc. This makes it easier to review without offending. 

E) Airbnb ""Miles"": sort of like airplane miles. Get some sort of credit and perks if you use Airbnb an enormous amount. I want to say ""I'm an Airbnb Gold member"", etc.

F) Airbnb + Orbitz: If I'm in New York City and I book an Airbnb in Florida for Jan 5, instantly bring me to a separate tab, where I can book a plane from New York to Florida on that day. Maybe get an ""Airbnb rate"" that you work out with the travel firm or airlines. 

G) Airbnb Concierge: Let's say I'm arriving at a place at 10 pm. I'm tired, but I need food. The concierge makes sure the refrigerator is stocked with my basics and that even a delivery of sushi is waiting for me when I arrive. I'd pay for this extra service.

H) Airbnb Extras: I should be able to go to a place and pay extra if I want a computer waiting for me, chargers, a ping pong table, etc.

I) Airbnb Real Estate: some places I'd like to stay at for the year. I'd like to see all the places where I can rent for a year. It will steal business from places like Trulia.

J) Airbnb / Calendar: Given my profile (I always like a certain type of place), and given my travel schedule on calendar, as soon as I make calendar change, Airbnb should send me a list of places that meet my profile and it's one click-acceptance.",
62,6,"Expectations between hosts and guests should be made clearer.

After nearly a year of living in AirBNBs around the world, I’ve noticed that hosts have wildly different expectations of how they want you to leave the apartment.

Often, as a long-term guest, you actually get stuck being an unpaid housesitter. This is because many hosts have a vague expectation that the apartment should be left “exactly as you found it”.

For someone staying for 2 days, that’s easy enough to do, because you won’t use the apartment very much. But if you’re staying for 2 months, “leaving it exactly as you found it” actually means regular upkeep, maintenance and a final “moving-out” style deep clean on your part (sweeping, refrigerator, oven, bathroom, dishes, garbage, etc.)… despite actually paying THEM a cleaning fee to do all that.

However, some hosts don’t expect this from you. Some only want you to do the dishes and take out the garbage. Some don’t expect anything and hire professional cleaners themselves. There’s no way of knowing what your host wants until they write you a review.

AirBNB’s response would be “ask the host beforehand”. But after many tries, I have never actually successfully gotten a host to clearly communicate their expectations to me. There are too many interests at stake—they want you to spend their money at their place and sound like a friendly host, and you want to sound like a nice, clean guest.

I wish AirBNB would drop the pretension of being some kind of cuddly “everyone shares” setup and just admit what it is—a holiday home rental site. Too many “games” go on between hosts and guests because expectations aren’t clear.",
63,6,"Airbnb could stop its phony Kumbaya “community” talk and stop the predatory corporate behavior it engages in.

A personal example: I just got screwed royally by the “Host Guarantee”.  [ https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-bad-experiences-from-Airbnb-guests-hosts/answer/Joh-Bhakdi ]One day after I posted the horrific behavior, I got this (mass) email from Brian Chesky, CEO of Airbnb, about evil hosts who discriminate against people they are supposed to let into their homes:

""Dear Airbnb community,

At the heart of our mission is the idea that people are fundamentally good and every community is a place where you can belong. (...) Discrimination is the opposite of belonging, and its existence on our platform jeopardizes this core mission. Bias and discrimination have no place on Airbnb, and we have zero tolerance for them. (...) We will not only make this right; we will work to set an example that other companies can follow. (...)""

Dude. The opposite of “belonging” is when the platform I trust openly lies about its host guarantee and engages in systematic fraud towards the people it makes money off. Maybe you start by NOT SCREWING PEOPLE OVER with your ""Host Guarantee"" and stop violating your own terms just because you think you are not getting sued.

Discrimination stuff is all fine and fuzzy, but if your company engages in outward, systematic consumer fraud, that's a more urgent issue to address. It’s one thing that there is a small fraction of hosts who want to discriminate against people they let into their own homes. It’s a whole different dimension if there is a whole COMPANY that gives false promises to ALL hosts. This company is yours - Airbnb.

64,6,"1. Verified Wifi - hosts can request a small box that plugs into the wall in the property and connects to the wifi network.  It periodically runs a speed test and sends the results to AirBNB.  After a week of testing, the property is assigned a speed rating and reliability number, which is displayed on the listing.  The data is then used to build an overall internet speed profile for any neighborhood or city. 
2. As an incremental step to Verified Wifi, walk hosts through the process of running a speed test and making that available.  The messaging system that obfuscates URL's makes communicating this extremely challenging.
3. AirBNB credit card (similar to an Amazon VISA) that earns miles or points on the platform, and can easily be selected as the payment option when booking a place.
4. No-interest financing via the AirBNB credit card (ala health care credit cards), particularly helpful for those who are booking extended stays of 1-3 months more than six months in advance.
5. Develop a Superguests Program that rewards the ""frequent flyer"" guests with points, badges, highlighted and weighted reviews, first look at new listings, extended stay opportunities, swag from travel companies.
6. Earn free nights or credits based on the number of nights stayed in AirBNB locations.

7. Ambassador Program that connects guests and hosts (including connecting experienced guests with new or interested hosts) in physical locations, i.e. monthly meetups.
8. Housesitting feature (free, paid or low-cost, depending on responsibilities, i.e. cat sitting) with a duration-based flat fee.

65,6,"How can Airbnb be improved?

Fix the ridiculous review system!

The problem with the review system, it is all based around Airbnb's steadfast desire to highlight something that could possibly be wrong.....not concentrate on those things that are right.

If we look at the guest to host review process and break it down into steps as I have done in this screenshot.

Step one says "" How was your stay at Rachel's place""?

Now the guest thinks....""The pictures looked great, the host had a heap of good reviews, communication was excellent, lots of nice touches, bed was fantastic, we were expecting something special and we got it!""

So, he puts in that first step which becomes the overall star rating, and what the host is rated by....... 5 stars!

Second step he ticks the items that impressed him, and then he comes to step 3, and, dear reader, here is where the whole thing goes off the rails!

How did your stay at Rachel's place compare to your expectations?

The guest then gets to think and he says to himself....

'We were expecting something pretty good and that's what we got, it met our expectations' ....

so, he ticks the middle box.......'About the same as I expected'!

He then thinks....""Well I can hardly give it 5 stars if Airbnb suggest that meeting our expectations is OK!""

So he goes back to step one and alters his overall star rating accordingly.

We know he does this because he gives us a 5 star in all the categories! There was nothing wrong, not a hint of what we might have been able to do better, no criticisms, the guest was expecting a good stay and that is what he got.

It's frustrating when you get them like this............

A great stay, it met your expectations, it was a 3 star…..to Airbnb that is a hosting fail!!!

You can't let it get you down, it's nothing either you or the guest have done wrong, it's just Airbnb's quaint way of punishing hosts for doing their best!

Airbnb…..bloody fix it!

Cheers..........Rob",
66,6,"Add:

They could add much better support for hosts offering multiple rooms in the same house/building. It’s extremely cumbersome to have to list all rooms separately, and re-enter all the same details that apply to all rooms in the same location.

Change:

They should quit pushing Instant Book to hosts. It’s really quite terrible: they actively hide hosts who prefer potential guests to contact them first for a chat about their expectations and requirements. I’m co-host for a lady who rents out some rooms above a bar in Thailand, and it just got instant-booked by a mormon family with young kids from Utah. W’ere of course forced to turn on instant-book because otherwise most guests don’t even see the place in the search results, but really if the guest had contact us first then I would have been very straightforward in the potential for some noise and perhaps lewdness around, and offered some recommendations. SO this is bad for the guest and actually also bad for the host because I think it’ll result in either a cancellation or a bad review. Hosts don’t want that, they want guests who are a good match for what they offer.

Other than that it’s pretty awesome though, but you did ask. :)",
67,6,"Airbnb shouldn’t allow guests to block dates on a host’s calendar if their payment falls through. We don’t get gas at the pump and airlines don’t hold our seats when our credit cards are declined! Why should it be any different with AirBnb?

I honestly don’t understand how this method makes AirBnb any more money. Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia, take note!

Guests blocking calendar without payment is a huge problem. It prevents hosts from updating their calendar on nights they cannot host and it prevents guests who have available funds to view the listing in their search. Not only that but this allows guests to hop around Airbnbs with naive hosts, spend the night but cancel the reservation after leaving and host loses money. Airbnb doesn’t get any money either.

Hosts can cancel this type of reservation penalty free. However, the host has to call AirBnb to manually cancel the “Awaiting Payment” reservation penalty-free. This is a waste of time and resources for both the AirBnb customer service and the host. Hosts and Airbnb should not put up with guests who do not have payment ready at time of booking!",
68,6,"I'm an Airbnb Superhost with over 200 reviews and a 97% five-star rating. I'm also a frequent Airbnb guest. Over the years, I've watched Airbnb try to become a guest-centered company, but since it is ultimately the host who provides the guest experience, the company has little leverage in the transaction. The result is that in their efforts they've dissed the hosts. Here are some examples. Instant booking simplifies the booking process while taking the power of choice away from hosts. It's the default option, so if hosts don't offer it, their listing is buried. Customer service used to treat superhosts with respect; no more. A new program, Airbnb Plus, is available only in a few cities and creates a superclass of venues. The effect is that excellent hosts in the same cities who do not quite qualify are left in the mud, and they're angry. Ditto for Airbnb Experience. These last two ""programs"" are also examples of mission creep, diluting the company's core business and focus. Beyond that, there's the question of tax payment. While cities add regulations, Airbnb is asleep at the wheel, leaving hosts to fend for themselves and collect taxes on their own. That's what other platforms have done, but up til now, the advantage of listing with Airbnb was that it freed the host from the financial part of the transaction, making it easier to maintain a ""home"" feel in the interaction with guests. Bottom Line: Airbnb is leaving their greatest asset—the superhosts—to wander over to HomeAway et al. They will lose share, without a doubt, but it's a self-inflicted loss.",
69,7,"Airbnb can be very profitable depending on where you live and what your business model is.

Why where you live?

1. You may not be legally allowed to Airbnb without certain restrictions because of where you live (check your city’s short term rental policies as well as check with your HOA if applicable). Different cities and towns have different restrictions and tax methods on short term rentals (Airbnbs). Paying the correct taxes for your area is a critical cost of Airbnb-ing.
2. Let’s say you live in a gorgeous home in a not so nice neighborhood - you could Airbnb your space for a pretty high price and probably be the most expensive Airbnb in your neighborhood.
3. Let’s say you live in a pretty nice home in a gorgeous neighborhood - you could be the cheapest Airbnb in a high price neighborhood.
Why does it depend on what your business model is?

1. If you are paying someone to manage your Airbnb (communicate with customers, clean between bookings, etc.) that will add costs to your Airbnb that a normal rental property wouldn’t incur. Considering being scrappy and managing everything you can yourself.
2. Will you rent out as much as possible and try to have every night booked? Will you only rent weekends? Will you offer Airbnb experiences such as cooking classes or city tours? How much work you are able to put into your Airbnb will decide how much income you can collect from bookings.
3. What are the costs of your home? Will Airbnb cover your mortgage? Will it only put a dent in it? Do the math and research you need to understand if Airbnb will truly generate a profit for you by connecting with other Airbnb hosts in your neighborhood or monitoring bookings of a comparable Airbnb.
Simply put, find out if you can Airbnb where you live, do the research on taxes and restrictions to Airbnb-ing your city, then research pricing to estimate about how much you think you can make.",
70,7,"Airbnb is a platform business model making money by charging guests a service fee between 5% and 15% of the reservation, while the commission from hosts is generally 3%. For instance, on a $100 booking per night set by a host, Airbnb might make as much as $15, split between host and guest fees.

The digitalization that happened in the last two decades has facilitated the creation of peer to peer platforms in which business models disrupted the hospitality model that was created in the previous century by hotel chains like Marriott, Holiday Inn, and Hilton.

As a platform, Airbnb makes money by enabling transactions on the peer-to-peer network of hosts and guests. And it charges both for the successful transaction that happened through the platform.

As a peer-to-peer platform, once the transaction between host and guest goes through, Airbnb will collect a fee from both key players. As an example from a $100 booking per night set by the host, Airbnb might collect $3 as a hosting fee. While it might increase the price for the guest at $116 ($16 above the price set by the host) to collect its guest fees of $12 and taxes for the remaining amount.",
71,7,"For me the profit is not in the rent. It’s in the Rent + Tax Write-Offs I can take on my property as a result of beer no an AirBnb host.

I claimed 50% of my property for AirBnb. So 50% of my mortgage, WI-FI, water, gas, cable, Netflix even my health insurance was a write-off.

I remodeled and 50% of that was a write-off. My remodel fell in 2 years so I did even better because of that.

I play very fair and honest with state and federal taxes. Never try to claim anything I shouldn’t. And even so often, AirBnb was an extraordinary way to create write-offs that helped me put my money into my house vs the pockets of the IRS.

So yes AirBnb wasn’t as profitable (dollars in my pocket from rent) as I thought it would be. But it helped me rage tax write-offs I would have never had without it.

That was my experience under previous tax laws. Check with your account people to see if that’s still true.",

Airbnb is one of numerous tech companies hitting the public markets without being profitable. It’s doing so as tech becomes an increasingly important part of the US economy and as lay investors are taking more interest in tech stocks. Meanwhile, Wall Street has become less tolerant of money-losing tech companies lately, so these losses will likely put a dent in Airbnb’s valuation, which was estimated to be worth more than $30 billion.

Airbnb makes money by charging a service fee — a percentage of the total — to both the people who rent out their space (hosts) and those who stay there (guests). The lion’s share of expenses and work fall on the hosts — they buy or rent the property, coordinate with guests, clean up after them — while Airbnb collects fees.",
73,7,"Airbnb is a platform for individuals to rent out their primary residences as lodgings for travelers. Renters typically seek accommodations with a homey feel that hotels cannot provide, while most hosts want to rent out their homes to supplement their income.

Airbnb raised $3.5 billion in its initial public offering on Dec. 10 at a fully diluted valuation of around $47.3 billion, debuting on the Nasdaq under the ticker ABNB and pricing its IPO at $68 a share. The company reported revenues of $1.34 billion last quarter, down nearly 19% from the same period a year ago.

The idea for Airbnb evolved after its founders, Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia, put an air mattress in the living room of their San Francisco apartment, turning it into a makeshift bed and breakfast. The pair rented the space out to travelers as a way to offset the high cost of rent. In 2008, the two, along with Nathan Blecharczyk, developed a website for short-term rentals that would eventually become Airbnb.",
74,7,"This common side hustle attracts many that are looking to form money off an existing asset: their home. About half, 54%, of these who own their house say they’d consider renting it out through a service like Airbnb, consistent with a recent survey of 1,000 people by land data company Clever. And 82% believe this is often an honest money-making strategy.

Airbnb hosts make, on the average , about $924 a month, consistent with research from low-interest lender Earnest. Of course, that income can vary dramatically counting on where you’re based, how frequently you hire out your home , the standard of your home and therefore the services you provide.

“You can set-up an Airbnb together with your existing space and you'll make an honest side income,” says Danny Rusteen, founding father of Airbnb and a former Airbnb employee.

Understand your upfront costs

Even if your house is perfect for you, it's going to not be for guests. So some redecorating is typically so as to eliminate the clutter and furnish the space. albeit you’re just renting out a spare room, you'll got to invest during a new bed frame and mattress.

“You need to realize everything should be furnished and it should be fairly new because you're competing with other Airbnb hosts,” Weber says. He pegs the value at roughly $1,500 per bedroom, plus another $2,000 to $3,000 for the remainder of the house and customary areas. Which is on par with other experts’ estimates.

WHAT IS AIRBNB?

Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects travelers with local hosts.

On the one hand, the platform allows people to list their available space and earn additional income in the form of rent.

On the other hand, Airbnb allows travelers to book unique accommodations with local host families, saving them money and giving them the opportunity to interact with the local population.

Airbnb is present in more than 190 countries around the world.

VALUE PROPOSALS

 * It allows owners to list their space on the platform and earn money from the rent.
 * Airbnb provides insurance for listed properties.
 * It offers cheap options to travelers to stay with local hosts.
 * Facilitates the process of reserving living space for travelers.
 * Rating and review system for hosts and guests.
 * Friendly application and web-based structure.
THE 5-STEP MODEL OF HOW AIRBNB WORKS

1. Hosts list their property details on Airbnb along with other factors such as prices, services provided, etc.
2. Airbnb dispatches a professional photographer (if available) to the property location to take high-quality photos.
3. Travelers are looking for a property in the city they want to stay in and looking for available options based on price, amenities, etc.
4. The reservation is made through Airbnb, where the traveler pays the amount mentioned by the host and some additional money for transaction costs.
5. The host approves the reservation. The traveler stays there and finally Airbnb pays the amount to the host after deducting their commission.
Host and traveler can rate each other and write reviews based on experience.

This

improves

the

operation of Airbnb

as both hosts and guests can make a decision based on the previous experiences that the participants have.

HOW DOES AIRBNB MAKE MONEY?

Airbnb offers free listings to owners and allows travelers to browse the listed spaces and select the one that best suits their needs on the platform.

Airbnb's business model is such that booking and monetary transactions take place on the Airbnb platform.

In this case, the company obtains its share of income from two different sources, which are explained below:

OWNERS COMMISSION (HOSTS)

Airbnb charges a flat 10% commission from hosts for each reservation made through the platform.

TRAVELER TRANSACTION FEE (GUEST)

Airbnb charges 3% of the reservation amount as transaction fees to travelers for each confirmed reservation.

HOW DO YOU FIND AIRBNB CUSTOMERS?

An Airbnb customer is one who adds to the company's income.

It can be a host who offers their space to rent and lists it on the platform or it can be a traveler who reserves a space.

So where does Airbnb find hosts and travelers from?",
76,7,"Airbnb makes money because it owns nothing and is responsible for nothing!

Airbnb takes 3–5% of the hosts listing amount from the hosts payout and charges the guest between 12–18% for the privilege of booking a hosts listing!

So Airbnb makes between 15–23% on every booking for nothing other than putting together a bit of software.

On any given night Airbnb holds $94.000.000 in hosting payouts which have been charged to guests credit cards but will not be released to the hosts account until, 24 hours after the guest has arrived….and that may be sometimes up to one year ahead.

Airbnb makes more money faster than any other (legal) enterprise on earth because it charges users for the privilege of using it’s services whilst not being responsible for any of the financial accountability for what it offers!",
77,7,"The peer-to-peer short-term rental services like Airbnb are becoming an alternative to many travelers. Some travelers are looking for the feel of home away from home. Others are looking for accommodations that will cover large groups in one place. Many also look to short-term peer-to-peer rentals as a less costly option than the standard hotel room.

You decide when to make your space available and at what price. Listing is free, and you can individually approve potential guests. In setting your price, you’ll want to consider the going rate in your area by looking at competing listings. You’ll want to consider the costs of hosting – including cleaning, higher utility bills, taxes, and Airbnb’s host fee, which is 3% for payment processing. Your guests pay Airbnb’s 6% to 12% booking fees. Make sure you understand Airbnb’s hosting standards for listing accuracy, communication with guests, keeping your reservation commitments, cleaning your place for each guest, and providing basic amenities such as soap and toilet paper.",

79,8,"It depends on what you mean when you say: ""Like AirBnB"" . If you are only talking about a site with a similar design and resources, it can be pretty cheap comparing to what AirBnB spend on their website, but it's far from what AirBnB really is.

When you build a website like AirBnB you need experts in many areas like UX, Development, Research, Analytics, Testing, Design, Planning, SEO, Online Marketing, Databases and many other areas to come up with a great website.

AirBnB is not an out-of-the-box solution and that's one of many reasons why it's so successful. The color of a button, the positioning of a picture, the length of  text and many other thousands of small factors make a huge difference in the User Experience and on the outcomes the website achieve.

Building a website like AirBnB involves a complex level of planning. Detail is a core part of Web design and development and it affects how much you are going to spend on your website. 

For every small feature you plan for your website you have to ask a lot of questions. Will it be useful? Who I see using this feature?  Is it really necessary? What's its purpose? Will it consume to many resources? How many events it will trigger? What are the options I can have? Can I A/B test that feature?  Based on your answers, you and your team will decide if it worth to build that feature and if it's going to take 1 hour or 30 days and if it will cost $100 dollars or $30,000.

For example, I want to include a search box at the top of the page. What is the widget size? How does it impact my design?  Will it auto complete to provide suggestions while you type into the field? How I integrate that with Analytics? Should I include other search dimensions, like categories? 

So you have to calculate the time it takes to go through this process, and how much it's going to cost or drop your requirements and get a cheap out of the box solution. 

The definition of what is important for a website may vary from company to company and many people will try to give you inputs of what you should do. Don't accept a simple solution, but first research a lot what is important for your site and what do your website have to have to achieve your goals. 

If you want a website like AirBnB you will probably need to build your own team in order to achieve your goals and you must have smart people working for you. If you don't have the resources for that, you might consider hiring a company to do the work for you, in this case you have to be very specific in your requirements, otherwise you might end up with a site completely different from what you expected. Don't come to a web development company and tell your dream expecting to receive a AirBnB in 3 months. It will never work. Come with a detailed project and tell them you want to be involved in every single step.

At the end,  the success of your website will depend solely on  business goals.  
So, your site may cost from $3,000.00 to $300,000.00. $3,000 if you get an out of the box solution and hire a developer to help you tweaking and installing, and $300,000.00 if you build a smart team to develop an amazing website and make it successful.

My recommendation? Start small. Check if your idea work and wait until you see some results. If you have more than a good idea, soon you are going to see the results and get some investors interested in helping you with your project.",
80,8,"To build a website that looks like airbnb - that's not too hard and there's probably a lot that can be done for not too much cost - a talented freelancer or outsource agency could probably set up an option for you for fairly cheap (e.g. under £10k) but without it working like airbnb it's unlikely this would give a major benefit to you.

To build a site that works like airbnb - that's more complex it requires investigation into the how airbnb's platform works and the processes going on behind the scenes. How does it connect home owners to renters? How does the booking system work? the search? the payment? things like sending out the automatic email updates all need considering - if you're prepared help out with the investigation work then maybe it could be done for around £60-80k (that's a really rough guess though - I don't know everything the airbnb site does) and what you would have is a site that can do all the things that airbnb can - but maybe it might turn out to be hard to use or not work for your specific idea.

To build a site that supports an overall business idea like airbnb's requires a lot of work - to research the business, the different users of the site, the flow of information, legal and technical requirements. Then planning, designing, creating and user testing and repeating and repeating until it is the right tool for the job. Even then you need to consider SEO and paid traffic, creating new content, changes in technology and constantly improving the process for users. It's a long term investment that you would need to invest hundreds of thousands into and carry on investing to be competitive.

I hope this helps explain the difference between how much a website might cost to build and what you actually get for your money. What you expect to get may differ from what your developer is expecting to build. Unless you've experience of commissioning websites like this you'll need a lot of experts around you to help make the right decisions about the site and your web business, just like airbnb did.",
81,8,"Do you mean a service like airbnb or a website like airbnb? If you mean a service, then website is only part of the product. The other key part is the inventory. Within building the inventory, you have to think about product pictures, descriptions, providing customer support etc.  If you don't have the inventory, you can't deliver value to the users. 

The website part of the product also consists of different parts:

1. Design: this you can cut corners on and perhaps even copy airbnb completely (depending on what domain you are targeting). Approximately: 2 (for a complete rip off) to 30 man days (for a reasonably original work complete with wireframes etc)

2. Backend technology: in all likelihood you can build a simple version of the site where you simply match buyers with sellers. Of course, you need to figure out reviews, dispute resolution functionality, duplicate properties (products) etc. Approximately: 15 - 30 man days for the first version 

3. Payment gateways: if you are looking to make money, you need to accept payments. If it's a marketplace you will need to create the system so that you can keep your commission and pay out the rest to the ""seller"". In Germany, this isn't straight forward and you need a banking or debt collection license for it or you need to use paypal's adaptive payments. approximately 3 to 15 man days not including the time it will take to create accounts if you go to a service other than paypal 

4. Front end implementation: since it's a market place, you need to implement different user ""flows"". For example, asking a seller questions before buying or seller asking buyer a question before selling (lack of trust is the key barrier in peer-to-peer business models). Approximately : 10-25 man days 

In total this can cost you at least 30 man days to 100 man days to come up with a launch able site without any backend staff and hosting etc 

You could outsource this to india and get a lower rate of $120 per man day or get devs and freelancers in U.S. for nearly $400 per day so the price ranges from $3600 to $40,000 depending on where you get it developed from.  Keep in mind, you mostly get what you pay for. 

An alternative approach to the above could be that you get the database developed for properties (or any products) and develop landing pages to display them online. Link it up with zendesk or freshdesk and provide direct support to the buyers regarding their demands. You could also A/B test the landing pages and see which ones drive highest conversion. This could be quicker as well as cheaper and would let you test your business model in the shortest possible time. 

I have made my answer anonymous as I run a similar company as others who have answered and didn't  want  to pitch my company here :)",
82,8,"The real cost of building a website like airbnb will cost you around 5000 USD to 15000 USD.

The cost you just read above is for developing a website completely similar to what Airbnb has now.

However, if you look forward to cutting the cost or building a website that is not exactly how Airbnb is now, it will cost you around 2000 USD to 5000 USD.

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE?

The site you are visualizing i.e. airbnb now, has got an extensive number of features, technology, and tools applied to it. While the site you need as an startup will not be including those extensive feature due to the reason and fact that Airbnb NOW HAS OVER

1500000 LISTINGS

IN 34000 CITIES

ACROSS 190 COUNTRIES

The above stats are the reason WHY AIRBNB USES EXTENSIVE FRAMEWORKS, TOOLS, AND TECHNOLOGIES.

To your knowledge, it took 7 Years for Airbnb to reach this level of success, visitors, customers, users, hosts, and more.

If you are looking forward to building a complete site similar to Airbnb, and you have the required funding one needs to launch an extensive site like Airbnb across 190 Countries, it will cost you around 2 million USD or may be more (we cannot calculate the exact cost as of now, for we need complete details and requirement to finalize an estimated cost as well as time period to complete a site like this).

WHAT WILL BE THE COST OF WEBSITE (LIKE AIRBNB) TARGETING A SPECIFIC (SINGULAR) COUNTRY INSTEAD OF MULTIPLE COUNTRIES?

The Cost We May Charge for a Website Like This:

Presuming that domain and hosting will be falling on your side, the cost may fall around- 5000 USD to 15000 USD, and may take 5 to 7 Weeks.",
83,8,"This question really depends on a few things and how to interpret the question, making the answers by Dhawal Barot [ https://www.quora.com/profile/Dhawal-Barot ] and even more by Dan Bullock [ https://www.quora.com/profile/Dan-Bullock-2 ] not quite true.

First of all it depends what you define as ""build"" and secondly what you define as ""like Airbnb"".

1. ""build""

As Dan Bullock [ https://www.quora.com/profile/Dan-Bullock-2 ] points out there are pre-built themes and plugins for Content Management Systems like Wordpress or Magento which would be suitable to build a website similar to (some of) the functionality of Airbnb.

But of course you are not quite done with just buying a theme and the plugins. There is time spent setting everything up and some recurring costs which are nicely displayed in Dhawal Barot [ https://www.quora.com/profile/Dhawal-Barot ]'s answer in the graphic under point 2. In the case of a website similar to Airbnb you would need all of the points listed under number 2.

Also of course Airbnb didnt just go out and get a finished template. I would assume some stuff was pre-made, especially in the very beginning, but they have likely spent a lot of time developing things. I have worked on a few very large projects and normally you dont start with pre-built stuff, depending on the kind of funding you have. 

You can expect to have at least 3 people working on it full-time for at the very least a few weeks even working from pre-made stuff. There is design to be done, research, coordinating, testing, developing, reviewing, more testing, marketing, finding funding, etc. This all takes a lot of time, which is not free.

Sure, we like to think that time is somehow free when you are a startup, but your time costs you at least as much money as you could earn in a full-time job. It's the same reason iPhones don't cost as little as the material costs, which is what a lot of people somehow expect it should.

2. ""Like Airbnb""

This is widely open to interpretation. Airbnb right now is HUGE, they built a new 170,000 sq.ft headquarters in san francisco [ http://www.designboom.com/architecture/airbnbs-170000-sq-ft-headquarters-in-san-francisco-12-11-2013/ ]. They are running TV commercials and have a  $13 Billion Valuation [ http://www.wsj.com/articles/airbnb-mulls-employee-stock-sale-at-13-billion-valuation-1414100930 ] as of October 2014. 

As they only do business through their website you could say it is their main asset and it would be indeed VERY challenging to make a website as successful as theirs.

They have a massive team of inhouse designers, researcher, UX experts and so on, so you could of course make a website that copies, but unlikely one with that much thought put into everything.

In 2014 they got a New Logo and Identity for Airbnb by DesignStudio [ http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_airbnb_by_designstudio.php ] in London. This was at least a 6-figure deal and was only for their identity.

So if you want a website with as much expertise and collective thought and testing put into it, you are looking at several million dollars. Not to mention the cost of running a website of their size is in the 10s of thousands of dollars a month for servers and maintenance.

Also people seem to forget about content. As a UX designer, I know how many people like to ignore this. But its a major part of a website. Creating good content takes a lot of time - both for creating it and also for adding it to your website.

Airbnb also hast to do a hell of a lot of coordinating, which you will need a few people for full-time. Answering help request, reviewing images and contents, coordinating photographers who photograph the apartments, etc. and doing this in all parts of the world.

____________

So wrapping this up, because I could go on and on with points where it simple depends on the interpretation of the question and what the goal is. 

Sure you can get some indian developers which will set you up a clone of something with the functionality of airbnb (although I doubt ALL of it) for maybe $20.000.

Or you could go to a good web design agency in the US or elsewhere and spend upwards of $100.000 dollars just for the web design. You would need another 5-figure amount to have a design agency create a good identity for you.

 Thirdly you could create your own startup and develop and design a website like that in-house, where you would need at least 5 people (1 manager/marketing, 1 backend developer, 1 front-end developer, 1 UX/Graphic Designer, 1 content creator), but you would need outside investment in the range of at least $1 million to run it till a point where you are actually earning money from it, which will  be at the very least 1 or 2 years after launch, while getting to launch will take at least 6 months for a website of that size and with the goal of making enough money to sustain itself.",
84,8,"Here's the thing, you're looking at AirBNB as a finished product. You've seen the effect of all of the hard work, but you haven't seen all of the hard work that went into it.

It probably took a team of developers and designers. Project managers. Marketers. Copywriters, and other content writers. Somewhere along the line, someone had to do the SEO. Someone had to design the interface. Someone had to build the hosting platform. Someone had to build the SOAP layer. Someone had to actually code the UI and make it work with every browser, and every phone. Every tablet.

A simple quote could be $7500. But what you need to be absolutely sure of is that you get a good team. Anyone can tell you they can build an app.

Who do you want building your app?

Make sure you look at every proposal and find a quality team to work with, someone who understands your vision and who can actually make it work.

Anything worth building is worth building right. If you take your project seriously, budget extra money for setbacks. Budget extra money for delays and extensions.

These things happen and are very much a part of website design, especially with larger projects. Take the steps to secure extra funding to make sure it works, and don't compromise.

Whatever company you decide to work with will give you a quote. I would say make sure you have at least 20% more than that. If you don't need it, great! But in the long run having it will give your project a good security cushion.

My personal quote? $15,000, 20% down non-refundable, 6 months of work.",
85,8,"I've done a lot of research on building a booking travel website like Airbnb. For a good solid start, you need a budget of $10,000+. Here's an outline of the approximate costs:

Current rates in the U.S for an experienced full stack developer capable of delivering this are anywhere between $50.00 and $80.00 per hour.

$30,000 to $48,000

 * That’s using a framework like Django or Rails at the application level.
 * Possibly a front end framework like Vue or React, if you believe your MVP should be API driven before you even test your ability to get traction.
 * A relatively straight forward conventional cloud architecture on AWS for infrastructure.
The above should get you a product that is good enough to test your ability to get traction.

There could be additional design and HTML/CSS costs if you’re not satisfied with the currently available responsive front end themes on the market.

If you do get traction then you’ll need to consistently build upon your infrastructure and application, or else it will crash and burn.

The technical work will be ongoing. Airbnb has a lot of engineers involved now.

A technical cofounder is an alternate approach to contracting this site out. Sweat equity for a piece of the venture.

You need a team of IT members who constantly work on website like this. You need programmers, coders, webdesigners, project managers, administrators etc...

It is also completely unimportant how much it costs. If UX designer come to you and say you that this new feature can increase your profit by 10% and it will take one month of work of your IT department which costs eg. 200.000 USD monthly and you earn 1 milion USD monthly would you pay for this feature?

If you are thinking about building something similar I can assure you it is rather a proccess than a project. You go to customers, implement ideas, collect a money and pay IT people, again and again. You do not build a website like this, you work on website like this to work everyday.",
88,8,"In theory, you can build a website for the cost of hosting and registering your domain, so that’s a few hundred dollars. If you’re skilled at programming and you know what you want the website to look at, you can probably produce the first version yourself.

However, your problems arise if your website is successful such as Airbnb. You then have to scale your website up from something that handles just your local area and using a single server into something that can handle millions of users all over the world, and thus runs on many servers. In addition, your website has to handle events such as crashes, server failures, attempts by hackers to break in to and or willfully disrupt your website, attempts by thieves to steal information, money or credit/debit card details etc.",

Air = air mattress

B = bed

N= and

B = breakfast

Shortly after moving to San Francisco in October 2007, roommates and former schoolmates Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia came up with the idea of putting an air mattress in their living room and turning it into a bed and breakfast.

In February 2008, Nathan Blecharczyk, Chesky's former roommate, joined as the Chief Technology Officer and the third co-founder of the new venture, which they named AirBed & Breakfast.

They put together a website that offered short-term living quarters and breakfast for those who were unable to book a hotel in the saturated market. The site Sitemap - Airbnb [ http://Airbedandbreakfast.com ] officially launched on August 11, 2008.

He founders had their first customers in town in the summer of 2008, during the Industrial Design Conference held by Industrial Designers Society of America, where travelers had a hard time finding lodging in the city.

In March 2009, the name of the company was shortened to Vacation Rentals, Homes, Experiences & Places - Airbnb [ http://Airbnb.com ], and the site's content had expanded from air beds and shared spaces to a variety of properties including entire homes and apartments, private rooms, and other properties.",

First on the controversial logo, Airbnb’s logo is called the Bélo, short for Belong Anywhere and the short form is easily pronounceable by anyone on Earth, or so they say.

The company idea was brainstormed in August 2007 and became Airbnb over the following year. It started off as Airbedandbreakfast.com. There’s a lot of video’s of Brian telling this story in depth and he’s a good storyteller so I recommend watching one.

Goes to show you a name doesn’t matter much. Most people think this is a bad name because you think planes or ‘air’, not staying in a home.

When I worked at Airbnb before it got popular, I remember having packages delivered to the office and I was say ‘Airbnb’ and the person on the other side of the phone said ‘huh!?! spell it out’. No longer an issue :D",
91,9,"Glad you’ve asked. It’s the funniest question I’ve ever encountered on Quora :)

You know, during my breaks when I get free time to kill, I often wonder, how did the founders of renowned companies like AirBnb, VROBO, and Housli discover such meaningful names for their businesses? It’s really tough to come up with a name that is easy to remember and fun to utter, right?

Well, the original name Airbnb is Air Bed and Air Breakfast, and it first showed up when Joe and Brian rented out their three airbeds to make some extra cash.

And later when the company grew up, they switch to a new name - AirBnb.

Hope it helps

92,9,"Airbnb (short for Air Beds&Breakfest) is a marketplace that connects travelers with local property owners.

For example, if you are a traveler and want to visit a city and you don’t want to stay in a hotel or hostel, Airbnb gives you many choices from which you can easily book a room or an apartment.

or there is another situation…

Imagine, you have an empty apartment that you want to make money from. You can become a host and earn money while providing the service of renting out your apartment or a part of it.

But what makes Airbnb so unique?

#1 SIMPLE INTERFACE: Despite the simplicity of the interface, Airbnb is a complex platform combining numerous features. First, there are three types of profiles: guest, host, and admin. The functionality of the guest and host profiles is created according to their needs.

#2 BETTER AMENITIES: Airbnb properties often offer better services than hotels.

#3 PRICE: the price of vacation rentals is usually lower than hotel rooms of comparable quality.

#4 BENEFITS FOR BOTH TRAVELLERS AND HOSTS: not only travelers see and use advantages of such an amazing platform but also hosts that earn money by providing travelers with rentals.

#5 UNIQUE VIEWS: rentals are usually located not in the center of the city but in those cute and appealing neighborhoods which give you the best experience and memories.

As you can see, these are the main reasons that make a big impact on travelers.

Obviously, most people prefer hotels with room service and all-inclusive but Airbnb offers something entirely different…

So, Airbnb is a total must-have in developing countries while it gives travelers the opportunity to save money and hosts to earn them.",

97,9,"Hi Robin, thanks for the A2A! Well I knew that the bnb part stood for “Bed and Breakfast,” but wasn’t sure about the “Air” part. So I went to Wikipedia.

Wouldn’t you know it: the company was started by three pals by plopping air mattresses on the floor and renting out their use by the night - hence, “Airbed & Breakfast”!

They’ve come pretty far since 2008. See Airbnb - Wikipedia [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb#History ].",
98,9,Airbnb stands for an out of town investor buying a once affordable housing unit and turning it into an unstaffed motel. Good luck renting one and wondering if the sheets were changed or toilets cleaned between bookings. Air stands for (airhead who rents one) bnb stands for the (bread and butter for the absentee investor who laughs all the way to the bank.) I’ve experienced these businesses in my town and everyone is up in arms about them … they’re not good for “community building.”,
