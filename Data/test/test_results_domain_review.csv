of stairs to get to the room, which is a little dark. i would suggest putting brighter lights, as it makes for easier packing and unpacking. the wifi signal was weak and spotty at times, so it's not great if you are heavily reliant on wifi. the building is made of wood and quite old, so sometimes you can hear feel vibrations when neighbours slam their doors (so make sure you don't slam yours). unfortunately, that's just part of staying in an old wooden apartment. the bathroom is a bit tight, and you will be instructed to leave the little window open, as there are no ventilators installed. as there's no heater in the bathroom, the bathroom will be very cold, if the weather is cold. get ready to sit on a cold toilet seat, which also happens to be unusually high. fortunately the shower doors help to keep the heat in while showering. if you stay here, watch out for the knobs that stick out of the bed rails. we jammed our hips into it several times, as the space between the bed and the wall and windows is quite narrow, and the room is dark. also, there is no hot water boiler/electric kettle in the room (due to an incident with a previous guest, we were told), so you won't be able to make coffee or tea. fortunately there are some really nice cafes and bakeries (go to <br/> c'est magnifique at leidsestraat 18) below and nearby. if not for the above-mentioned points, i would

there are a number of bars on the street, as well as some pretty nice restaurants. that being said, the noise from people walking around and leaving bars is pretty loud until around 4am. i didn't mind it because i was out late and just passed out as soon as i got back. another thing to note is that the stairs in edwin's house are very narrow so it can be hard to bring a full-sized suitcase up the stairs. if you travel light, you shouldn't have any problems though. i'd definitely stay there again!

"", ""after we arrived daniel showed us the accommodations and offered us something to drink. we proceeded to talk for the better part of three hours. daniel is one of the most agreeable and accommodating people i have stayed with through airbnb. in his apartment are countless books about amsterdam that one can leaf through. however, if you don't like to read, he can show you places to go and tell you about locales to visit that are not only interesting for tourists but for locals as well. he provides you with numerous maps, so you will never be wanting a reference if you happen to lose your way. it was a warm and informative welcome. \r<br/>\r<br/>the accommodations were spectacular. there are ample nooks in which to store your baggage, so what at first appears to be a modestly-sized room for two people with luggage turns out to be rather spacious. the room is equipped with a water heater, instant coffee, and tea, so if the need for a morning pep-up settles upon you, it is right there in your room. each bed is equipped with a reading lamp and the heater is placed nicely between the heads of the bed. we were never cold. the bathroom and toilet were kept impeccably clean and the towels were washed when we needed them. the orchids throughout the apartment were also very beautiful, and when we wanted some fresh air we needed only to open the window to the garden that is situated between the beds. \r<br/>\r<br/>the location of the apartment should suit those who want quick access to the city center without the bustle and noise. if one wishes to go by foot, one can get to the many attractions old city in about 30-45 minutes, depending on how fast one walks. it is an enjoyable city to walk in: very flat, organized, neighborhood markets everyday, different languages and cultures always surrounding you. the apartment itself is in a primarily non-native-dutch neighborhood, so you're exposed from the get-go to the nice mix of cultures that amsterdam harbors. the area is quiet but active. staying here, one also experiences the everyday life of amsterdam and avoids an environment overly saturated with tourists. there is a school, many shops for locals, and a playground for children in the vicinity. flevo park is about a five-minute walk from the apartment, which is nice if you want to spend an afternoon among the storks, swans, and sandy soil upon which amsterdam is rooted.  \r<br/>\r<br/>to the host himself: daniel is helpful. he makes sure you are comfortable and is always open to questions and offering suggestions. he takes care of without meddling over you. you could talk to him not only about amsterdam but many things: the art in his apartment, the furniture, films, etc. we had no complaints and were very happy to have stayed there. if you wish to visit amsterdam but avoid the bustle, this is where you should stay."", ""daniel was a great host, very attentive and prudent. his appartement was just as shown in the photos, very homely and clean and it smelled very nice and fresh. hence we really enjoyed staying with him. \r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>after booking he sent us a nice email with lots of information and responded quickly to our questions.\r<br/>\r<br/>when we arrived in amsterdam, we got a phone call from daniel making sure we found his place okay. he is a calm, very friendly person who is fluent in english. \r<br/>\r<br/>upon arriving in niasstraat, anna and i realised that we didn’t know his last name, so we were worried, if we’d find his doorbell. to our surprise, he put his first name on the doorbell which is smart and gives him the benefit of a little more anonymity. \r<br/>\r<br/>we were greeted by daniel at the door who invited us in and offered us something to drink. we were sitting in his living room, which is decorated with african wooden figures, listening to the pachelbel canon. \r<br/>he gave us lots of valuable information, including various maps (public transport, of the neighborhood and whole city), aswell as bus and tram schedules. \r<br/>\r<br/>you could tell from every detail that daniel handles his hosting very professionally: he has a door lock with a key code, which he individually changes for every guest. his wifi passwort was also changed specifically for our stay. we were positively surprised! \r<br/>for security reasons, he also installed an infrared webcam in his hallway, which is okay but he forgot to mention it.\r<br/>\r<br/>after that he gave us the tour of his appartement. it’s a cozy, very tidy place with a guest room looking at the garden.\r<br/>there are two beds, on top of each layed two rolled-up towels. they were color-marked red and orange respectively, so we would not confuse them in the bathroom. another smart detail. \r<br/>the room had all the extras as described and seen in the photographs. daniel cleaned the dishes for us after every time we made tea and also cleaned our waste basket every day. \r<br/>wifi reception was not the best in the bedroom (we used two android smartphones). enough for (hidden by airbnb) , but not enough for watching youtube clips. a wifi repeater in the room would be a good solution to this problem. \r<br/>\r<br/>after this he showed us the bathroom. i was amused by a small homo-erotic piece of art attached to the bathroom door. the bathroom, like the rest of the appartment, was very clean, with a nice shower, space for toiletries on the washing machine and color-marked towel bars. the toilet was not in the bathroom, but an own seperate room.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>we can highly recommend @daniel's and if we'll be visting amsterdam again we would try to stay with him again.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>hartstikke bedankt daniel!"", ""staying at daniel's place was as enjoyable as one could imagine. he welcomed us very kindly, showed us around and offered cold drinks. then he already provided us with useful pieces of information.\r<br/>the room is absolutely cosy and offers everything one would need. the beds are very comfortable und it's a rather quiet neighbourhood. he provided towels and linen and the whole flat was very tidy.\r<br/>his daily weather forecast was not only useful but more so very accurate.\r<br/>i would stay at his place again anytime. highly recommended."", 'daniel ist sehr zuvorkommend und denkt an alles!

\r<br/>for security reasons, he also installed an infrared webcam in his hallway, which is okay but he forgot to mention it.\r<br/>\r<br/>after that he gave us the tour of his appartement. it’s a cozy, very tidy place with a guest room looking at the garden.\r<br/>there are two beds, on top of each layed two rolled-up towels. they were color-marked red and orange respectively, so we would not confuse them in the bathroom. another smart detail. \r<br/>the room had all the extras as described and seen in the photographs. daniel cleaned the dishes for us after every time we made tea and also cleaned our waste basket every day. \r<br/>wifi reception was not the best in the bedroom (we used two android smartphones). enough for (hidden by airbnb) , but not enough for watching youtube clips. a wifi repeater in the room would be a good solution to this problem. \r<br/>\r<br/>after this he showed us the bathroom. i was amused by a small homo-erotic piece of art attached to the bathroom door. the bathroom, like the rest of the appartment, was very clean, with a nice shower, space for toiletries on the washing machine and color-marked towel bars. the toilet was not in the bathroom, but an own seperate room.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>we can highly recommend @daniel's and if we'll be visting amsterdam again we would try to stay with him again.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>hartstikke bedankt daniel!"", ""staying at daniel's place was as enjoyable as one could imagine. he welcomed us very kindly, showed us around and offered cold drinks. then he already provided us with useful pieces of information.\r<br/>the room is absolutely cosy and offers everything one would need. the beds are very comfortable und it's a rather quiet neighbourhood. he provided towels and linen and the whole flat was very tidy.\r<br/>his daily weather forecast was not only useful but more so very accurate.\r<br/>i would stay at his place again anytime. highly recommended."", 'daniel ist sehr zuvorkommend und denkt an alles!

"", ""after we arrived daniel showed us the accommodations and offered us something to drink. we proceeded to talk for the better part of three hours. daniel is one of the most agreeable and accommodating people i have stayed with through airbnb. in his apartment are countless books about amsterdam that one can leaf through. however, if you don't like to read, he can show you places to go and tell you about locales to visit that are not only interesting for tourists but for locals as well. he provides you with numerous maps, so you will never be wanting a reference if you happen to lose your way. it was a warm and informative welcome. \r<br/>\r<br/>the accommodations were spectacular. there are ample nooks in which to store your baggage, so what at first appears to be a modestly-sized room for two people with luggage turns out to be rather spacious. the room is equipped with a water heater, instant coffee, and tea, so if the need for a morning pep-up settles upon you, it is right there in your room. each bed is equipped with a reading lamp and the heater is placed nicely between the heads of the bed. we were never cold. the bathroom and toilet were kept impeccably clean and the towels were washed when we needed them. the orchids throughout the apartment were also very beautiful, and when we wanted some fresh air we needed only to open the window to the garden that is situated between the beds. \r<br/>\r<br/>the location of the apartment should suit those who want quick access to the city center without the bustle and noise. if one wishes to go by foot, one can get to the many attractions old city in about 30-45 minutes, depending on how fast one walks. it is an enjoyable city to walk in: very flat, organized, neighborhood markets everyday, different languages and cultures always surrounding you. the apartment itself is in a primarily non-native-dutch neighborhood, so you're exposed from the get-go to the nice mix of cultures that amsterdam harbors. the area is quiet but active. staying here, one also experiences the everyday life of amsterdam and avoids an environment overly saturated with tourists. there is a school, many shops for locals, and a playground for children in the vicinity. flevo park is about a five-minute walk from the apartment, which is nice if you want to spend an afternoon among the storks, swans, and sandy soil upon which amsterdam is rooted.  \r<br/>\r<br/>to the host himself: daniel is helpful. he makes sure you are comfortable and is always open to questions and offering suggestions. he takes care of without meddling over you. you could talk to him not only about amsterdam but many things: the art in his apartment, the furniture, films, etc. we had no complaints and were very happy to have stayed there. if you wish to visit amsterdam but avoid the bustle, this is where you should stay."", ""daniel was a great host, very attentive and prudent. his appartement was just as shown in the photos, very homely and clean and it smelled very nice and fresh. hence we really enjoyed staying with him. \r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>after booking he sent us a nice email with lots of information and responded quickly to our questions.\r<br/>\r<br/>when we arrived in amsterdam, we got a phone call from daniel making sure we found his place okay. he is a calm, very friendly person who is fluent in english. \r<br/>\r<br/>upon arriving in niasstraat, anna and i realised that we didn’t know his last name, so we were worried, if we’d find his doorbell. to our surprise, he put his first name on the doorbell which is smart and gives him the benefit of a little more anonymity. \r<br/>\r<br/>we were greeted by daniel at the door who invited us in and offered us something to drink. we were sitting in his living room, which is decorated with african wooden figures, listening to the pachelbel canon. \r<br/>he gave us lots of valuable information, including various maps (public transport, of the neighborhood and whole city), aswell as bus and tram schedules. \r<br/>\r<br/>you could tell from every detail that daniel handles his hosting very professionally: he has a door lock with a key code, which he individually changes for every guest. his wifi passwort was also changed specifically for our stay. we were positively surprised! \r<br/>for security reasons, he also installed an infrared webcam in his hallway, which is okay but he forgot to mention it.\r<br/>\r<br/>after that he gave us the tour of his appartement. it’s a cozy, very tidy place with a guest room looking at the garden.\r<br/>there are two beds, on top of each layed two rolled-up towels. they were color-marked red and orange respectively, so we would not confuse them in the bathroom. another smart detail. \r<br/>the room had all the extras as described and seen in the photographs. daniel cleaned the dishes for us after every time we made tea and also cleaned our waste basket every day. \r<br/>wifi reception was not the best in the bedroom (we used two android smartphones). enough for (hidden by airbnb) , but not enough for watching youtube clips. a wifi repeater in the room would be a good solution to this problem. \r<br/>\r<br/>after this he showed us the bathroom. i was amused by a small homo-erotic piece of art attached to the bathroom door. the bathroom, like the rest of the appartment, was very clean, with a nice shower, space for toiletries on the washing machine and color-marked towel bars. the toilet was not in the bathroom, but an own seperate room.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>we can highly recommend @daniel's and if we'll be visting amsterdam again we would try to stay with him again.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/>hartstikke bedankt daniel!"", ""staying at daniel's place was as enjoyable as one could imagine. he welcomed us very kindly, showed us around and offered cold drinks. then he already provided us with useful pieces of information.\r<br/>the room is absolutely cosy and offers everything one would need. the beds are very comfortable und it's a rather quiet neighbourhood. he provided towels and linen and the whole flat was very tidy.\r<br/>his daily weather forecast was not only useful but more so very accurate.\r<br/>i would stay at his place again anytime. highly recommended."", 'daniel ist sehr zuvorkommend und denkt an alles!

there are a number of bars on the street, as well as some pretty nice restaurants. that being said, the noise from people walking around and leaving bars is pretty loud until around 4am. i didn't mind it because i was out late and just passed out as soon as i got back. another thing to note is that the stairs in edwin's house are very narrow so it can be hard to bring a full-sized suitcase up the stairs. if you travel light, you shouldn't have any problems though. i'd definitely stay there again!

great if you are heavily reliant on wifi. the building is made of wood and quite old, so sometimes you can hear feel vibrations when neighbours slam their doors (so make sure you don't slam yours).

doors help to keep the heat in while showering. if you stay here, watch out for the knobs that stick out of the bed rails. we jammed our hips into it several times, as the space between the bed and the wall and windows is quite narrow, and the room is dark. also, there is no hot water boiler/electric kettle in the room (due to an incident with a previous guest, we were told), so you won't be
